<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p>Vicky Holloway is a web designer, animator and illustrator based in Wellington, New Zealand. Some of Vicky’s work is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Vicky first became aware of Creative Commons in 2005, though it wasn’t until she joined a collaborative art project in 2009 that she seriously considered using Creative Commons licensing. As she says, “We were looking for ways to license our work so that we could share it with other people, and maybe take it further as a group project.”</p>
<p>While following the <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash</a> competitions in 2010 and 2011, Vicky started using Creative Commons licences for <a href="http://www.behance.net/squibbleworld" target="_blank">her Behance portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>As she explains, Creative Commons licensing on Behance is “built into the process. You must choose a license before publishing your work and they make it easy to choose which CC license is the best for you.”</p>
<p>The benefit of using Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, is that “it explicitly states ‘this is how I want my work to be used.’ And it also gives a link to further information. The licences make it very straightforward and easy to understand. It makes it easy to tell people what kinds of use you are happy with—and also what kinds of use you’re not happy with.</p>
<p>“I love how the internet encourages curiosity and creativity. However, the rights of the artist should still be protected. A CC license allows me to state exactly what I want to happen to my work and comes with a clear label.</p>
<p>"A CC license also gives me the option to share while protecting my copyright. I make a conscious decision on copyright each time I label a graphic, painting or animation.”</p>
<p>The Creative Commons licences, Vicky says, “protect me as well as the creator. Without a licence, it’s unclear what kinds of sharing and reuse the creator would be comfortable with. It can also be hard to find the owner of the artwork, if you want to legally reuse it.”</p>
<p>Vicky is currently licensing her work using a ‘No Derivatives’ licence. “I might be interested in remix for some of my work. At the moment, though, the ‘No Derivatives’ licence gives me the option to retain control over the work. I think Share-Alike is fantastic if you want to go down the path of promoting yourself. It gives you a wider audience by making it easier for people to share and reuse your work.”</p>
<p>Vicky looks forward to releasing more work under Creative Commons licensing in the future. She is currently working on a website where users can download free graphics and wallpapers. She is planning to release themes for a small fee, also using Creative Commons licensing. She is considering Creative Commons licensing for her other projects, including a compilation of a web-comic and a series of Vlogs.</p>
<p>You can see more of Vicky’s work at her website, <a href="http://www.squibble.org/" target="_blank">Squibble</a>, and her <a href="http://www.behance.net/squibbleworld" target="_blank">Behance portfolio</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.wikihouse.cc/" target="_blank">WikiHouse</a> is an ambitious global open hardware project that aims to “allow anyone to design, download and ‘print’ CNC-milled houses and components, which can be assembled with minimal formal skill or training.”
<p><a href="http://thinkradical.net/" target="_blank">New Zealand’s WikiHouse Lab</a> was formed by Martin Luff and Danny Squires, who discovered the idea after the second <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake" target="_blank">Canterbury earthquake</a> in February 2011. As Martin puts it, “Danny and myself were trying to find a solution to a whole number of different issues in the built environment. We spent about six months researching different systems. During that process, a friend tipped us off to the WikiHouse project.”</p>
<p>After the Canterbury earthquakes, over 6100 businesses were displaced from the central city. “Only about ten of those have gone back to their original location,” Martin says. “The rest needed to relocate somewhere else. We were looking for a system whereby, in the worst case scenario, within a few weeks you could relocate your business and be back up in running.”</p>
<p>Martin and Danny were also keen to empower the local community. “A lot of people down here in Canterbury are stuck in limbo because they are dependent on a whole hierarchy of other agencies before they can get on with things like repairs and replacement housing.</p>
<p>“One particular thing we were looking for was a system that allowed people to be involved right from the get-go, through the whole design process, right the way to implementation. One of the really nice things about WikiHouse is that the people can really assemble the things on the ground themselves, as well being involved in the whole design process along the way. One of the main things we looking at was empowerment.”</p>
<p>As Martin explains, WikiHouse could also make housing more affordable. With WikiHouse, young people looking to enter the housing market would be able to start small, and be able to expand when they need to. Parents with large houses would also be able to break off sections of their house, to pass on to their children as a ‘starter-kit’—a form of “hand-me-down housing.”</p>
<p>Martin and Danny also wanted to ensure that what they produced was healthier, stronger and more environmentally friendly than the current housing stock. “We wanted it to be world-class in terms of its ability to stand up to seismic resistance. We also wanted it, longer-term, to go beyond sustainability to something that could be restorative to our environment.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons licensing is a core part of WikiHouse. As Martin explains, “Creative Commons is essential to the whole WikiHouse project. There are <a href="http://www.wikihouse.cc/guide" target="_blank">ten core principles</a>, and principle number one is be lazy like a fox. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Copy, adapt, give credit and share.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons licensing enables WikiHouse teams from around the world to collaborate and improve on each other’s designs. By way of example, Martin explains that the initial WikiHouse design “had a lot of mechanical fixings in it. A collective design effort quickly eliminated the need for those. The system we’ve got at the moment can be put together without power tools, by unskilled people in a very short length of time. There are no mechanical fixings in it, no bolts or screws or glue.”</p>
<p>Going forward, Martin sees WikiHouse taking off through a series of local projects, “probably neighbourhood based manufacturing plants, where local people can drop in, not just to build buildings, but all sorts of other things as well.” This global network of community-based organisations is where Creative Commons licensing becomes important.</p>
<p>“We really see this as a social enterprise, and it’s only going to work if we can deliver on scale—very large scale. One of the workshops we’re setting up in the WikiHouse project is in Rio. The global perspective on the project is that in the next 40 to 50 years, if the projections hold true, then we’ve got to built as much urban development globally as currently is in existence. This is mind-boggling. We can’t do that with conventional building techniques or without openly working together on solutions.”</p>
<p>In 2012, WikiHouse Rio won part of the <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2013/02/27/8-great-ideas-for-cities-the-city-2-0-award-winners-in-video/" target="_blank">TED City Prize 2.0</a>, for its project setting up an “open source maker lab in the heart of the <em>favela</em>.” With its Creative Commons licence, this project could potentially be duplicated—and improved—in other cities around the world.</p>
<p>“As I see it, if you’re shutting away that information, the things that you learn, then it’s essentially a waste-stream. It seems critical that, as far as possible, you’re open. If you take the bigger picture, it can seem a bit petty to fence that knowledge away, and charge people to access it; especially since any new idea only ever builds incrementally on all the knowledge and wisdom that went before. Creative Commons seems like a great way to acknowledge that.”</p>
<p>Open source hardware, however, is still a new concept, especially for highly-regulated industries like construction. “It’s much trickier to get the globally distributed network right, especially when it’s a mix of professionals and amateurs.”</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Danny and Martin, along with the founding WikiHouse team in the UK, are looking to have a finished house by the end of the year. “That’s one of the beauties of a large, open source project: It’s surprising how quickly it can progress.”</p>

<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p>In June 2012, Youtube user ‘gloveandboots’ released ‘<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt9zSfinwFA" target="_blank">The Vertical Video Syndrome – A PSA</a>,’ a video poking fun at film-makers who hold their camera-phone vertically. Common across Youtube, videos shot vertically have two black bands of empty space framing the video, as you can see the screenshot, below.</p>
<p>The Vertical Video Syndrome quickly went viral, picking up over three million views on Youtube. Noticing the popularity of the video, <a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz/seftms/about/staff/miriam-ross" target="_blank">Miriam Ross</a>—an academic and filmmaker based in Wellington, New Zealand—decided to respond. With research assistant Maddy Glen, Miriam produced the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buHSJitp46w" target="_blank">Vertical Cinema Manifesto</a>, arguing that Vertical Cinema was, in fact, a legitimate cinematic form.</p>
<p>As Miriam explains, “The ‘Vertical Video Syndrome was very humorous, but when you see it getting circulated online, it’s used as a form of policing.</p>
<p>“We wanted to get away from that. We wanted to say, we have all these new tools, let’s see what can happen. It’s all very experimental. Hopefully the manifesto is a celebration of what can be done.”</p>
<p>The result was a close parody of the Vertical Cinema Syndrome. Replete with quotes from feminist film scholar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Mulvey" target="_blank">Laura Mulvey</a>,The result was a close parody of the Vertical Cinema Syndrome. Replete with quotes from feminist film scholar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Mulvey" target="_blank">Laura Mulvey</a>, the film closes with six recommendations, the forth of which reads, "A Creative Commons licence must be used."</p>
<p>The ideas around the manifesto tied into an honours film course Miriam was teaching at the time, on DIY filmmaking. “That paper framed the project. Part of that is trying to move away from the hierarchies around filmmaking--the idea that there’s a ‘best way’ to make films.</p>
<p>“We were looking at how people use the technology they have in their hands to make films with no budget or resources. Obviously, with DIY filmmaking the Creative Commons licences became very interesting. It tied into both the courses I teach and our project. Because we’ve got no money, we’ve been wanting to find material we can use for free. But we also want to take part in this Creative Commons culture that’s going round now, where people are licensing their work for free.”</p>
<p>Miriam is also interested in how DIY filmmakers remix and reuse other cultural works. As she points out, “There’s a lot of debate now, because video essays are becoming more popular. Film academics who are using video clips, and sometimes using voiceover to narrate the clips, and that’s could come up against copyright.”</p>
<p>As Miriam points out, one of the problems is that New Zealand lacks the broad Fair Use allowances enjoyed in the US. Even the Vertical Cinema Manifesto itself, which uses small parts of several copyright films, could occupy a grey area, despite <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1994/0143/latest/DLM345961.html" target="_blank">New Zealand’s Fair Dealing exceptions for criticism and review</a>.</p>
<p>“It is tricky. One of the things I teach in my course is mashups and video remixes. They are a huge part of our contemporary culture, and they’re all operating in this grey area. It’s strange because the companies, especially film companies, want their films talked about. The mashups are often a form of advertising for them, but they still aren’t promoting this sort of use.”</p>
<p>More recently, Miriam and Maddy produced Heaven, a short ‘vertical’ film currently under consideration for film festivals. “It’s an exploration of what we can do with very little resources and money, using new technologies.”</p>
<p>This film, like the Manifesto itself, was made collaboratively with friends and colleagues, and will carry a Creative Commons licence when released.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s great about Creative Commons. It encourages people to take something and just see what they can do with it. That’s the kind of spirit I want to see more of. Instead of trying to be an auteur starting from scratch to make something unique and singular, why not build on what other people are doing to create something that’s maybe more hybrid, but maybe more exciting as a result.”</p>

<p>Dan Untitled is the stage name of Dr Dan James, a performer, curator, Open Source Film supporter and trustee of the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Freedom Foundation</a>. He is also the co-host of <a href="http://www.radioactive.co.nz/" target="_blank">Radio Active’s Messed Up</a>, New Zealand’s longest running mashup show, and a member of the Bootie NZ mashup crew.</p>
<p>Dan holds a PhD in Fine Arts from Massey University, specialising in Mashup performance. In 2011, he performed '<a href="http://vimeo.com/38643007" target="_blank">Breakfast Party in my Studio</a>', a live audiovisual mashup piece, to the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. In 2012, Dan curated eleven different exhibitions for Radio Active's <a href="http://www.radioactive.fm/MoMA" target="_blank">Museum of Modern Activity</a>, including <a href="http://www.radioactive.fm/MoMAFairDeal" target="_blank"><em>Fair Deal</em></a>, <em>Interwoven</em> (a 10 year retrospective of Alyx Duncan), and <em>Having a Bit Too Much Fun</em> (music videos of Simon Ward).</p>
<p>Earlier projects include <a href="http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/events/2008/seance/">Seance for Nam June Paik</a>, 2008; Intimacy and In.yer.face, 2006; and Indeterminacy and Interface, 2005.</p>
<p>Dan first used Creative Commons licensing when he became involved with <a href="http://www.straycinema.com/" target="_blank">Stray Cinema</a>, an international open source film project, in 2006. As Dan explains “Stray Cinema operates in rounds. For each round, footage is shot in a different city, with a different director. The first round was shot in London, by Michelle Hughes. She decided to license all of her raw, unedited footage, before she’d even made a film out of it. She wanted other people making their own stories out of the same material, concurrently to her making her own film."</p>
<p>After Michelle released her raw footage on the <a href="http://www.straycinema.com/" target="_blank">Stray Cinema site</a>, participants from all over the world re-edited her work. Afterwards, Michelle’s was shown alongside the top five participant films. This also occurred for the second round, with footage shot in Barcelona. The third round took place in 2012, with a screening to be held in Melbourne, later this year.</p>
<p>In 2006, Dan also became involved with <a href="http://upstage.org.nz/blog/" target="_blank">UpStage</a>, a web platform for live online performance, eventually helping to curate online UpStage festivals from 2008 to 2010. This platform is licensed <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike</a> and, as Dan points out, “a lot of people using the platform Creative Commons license the visual and audio content of the works themselves.”</p>

<p>These days, Dan’s main involvement with Creative Commons licensing comes with his mashup projects, which he releases under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike licence</a>. As he says, “Nowadays, any music I do, I’ll licence it under Creative Commons. Some might debate about licensing mashups as CC. In my mind, though, this is in line with my argument that a mashup is a unique creation. What I’m licensing is my combination, my mix of this plus this plus this, in this particular way, with all these tweaks and changes. I don’t release all the source material that I used to create it and the licence doesn’t apply to the source material.”</p>
<p>Dan likes to use Creative Commons licences “because of the flexibility. I want to be able to say outright, feel free to use this, however you want to use it. For my non-mashup work I also like the ability to be able to set tiers of how I want something to be used or not used.”</p>
<p>In November 2012, Dan curated<a href="http://www.radioactive.fm/MoMAFairDeal" target="_blank"> an art show commissioned by the Fair Deal Coalition</a>, which included several pieces made available under a Creative Commons licence, including <a href="http://bronwyn.co.nz/projects/whisper-down-the-lane/" target="_blank">Bronwyn Holloway-Smith’s Whisper Down the Lane</a> (read <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">a case study of Bronwyn</a>). Run by InternetNZ, <a href="http://fairdeal.net.nz/" target="_blank">Fair Deal</a> is a coalition of organisations seeking to prevent any changes to New Zealand law resulting from the ongoing Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations.</p>
<p>Dan became involved with the Fair Deal Coalition because he was concerned with with how copyright law affects New Zealand artists. “I would,” Dan says, “like to see a lot more clarity about Fair Use and Fair Dealing, because that’s what impacts directly on my work. The current default when distributing work online is that you’re guilty until proven innocent... That’s not based on expert opinion, that’s based on a computer programme scanning the waveform of the visual content. As an artist, I find that really offensive.”</p>
<p>Dan points to the history of remix and reuse in music. “There’s centuries of tradition in all creative fields of artists referencing each other’s work in various ways. The only difference is the technology."</p>
<p>“It’s no different from a composer a couple of centuries ago lifting a whole section from somebody else’s composition and using it. The Baroque composer Handel is a good example - his work commonly quoted entire passages from other peoples' compositions. There are countless examples of different artists appropriating the work of others, it’s been going on for centuries - it’s well accepted in all sorts of different mediums and artforms.”</p>

<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p>In 2010, Jem Yoshioka decided to enter <a href="http://www.mixandmash.org.nz/" target="_blank">Mix &amp; Mash</a>, then a new initiative from <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> and the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand</a>. Reusing Katherine Mansfield’s poem ‘<a href="http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-ManPoem-t1-body-d2-d11.html" target="_blank">An Opal Dream Cave</a>,’ Jem produced a short comic of <a href="http://jemshed.com/comic/opal-dream-cave/" target="_blank">the same name</a>.</p>
<p>With this entry, Jem won the <a href="http://www.thebigidea.co.nz/news/interviews/2011/aug/90474-jems-remixed-dreams" target="_blank">Creative Commons category of Mix &amp; Mash</a>. As Jem relates, “That was when I began to think about how I could use Creative Commons material in my work, and also start licensing my own work under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>“I then decided to open up my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jemshed/" target="_blank">Flickr stream</a>. Now, everything I put online I licence under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>The comics on Jem’s website, including <a href="http://jemshed.com/comic/opal-dream-cave/" target="_blank">An Opal Dream Cave</a> and <a href="http://jemshed.com/comic/sunshine/" target="_blank">Sunshine</a>, are all made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike licence</a>. Many more photos, illustrations, comics and sketches are made available under the same licence on her Flickr stream.</p>
<p>As Jem explains, “I use Creative Commons for many reasons, one of them being that I really do believe that copyright is outdated, especially given the way we can share things online. It becomes more of a burden than anything. Instead of encouraging creativity, it begins to block it.</p>
<p>“By using an open licence, it actually gives me a lot more freedom to say what I want done with my work. I don’t have to worry about people infringing on my rights, as it’s very clear what can be done with my work.”</p>
<p>Jem chose to use the Share Alike licence so “everyone that uses my work is also contributing to Creative Commons. It’s a ways of increasing the pool of work and encouraging the conversation.”</p>
<p>“The Share Alike licence is a way for me to contribute to the Creative Commons environment.”</p>
<p>Unlike some artists—like <a title="Dylan Horrocks" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2013/01/dylan-horrocks/" target="_blank">Dylan Horrocks</a>—Jem chose not to apply a Non-Commercial licence to her work. As she explains, “People can make money off my work. I’m really not too fussed about that, as long as it’s got my name on it, they can do whatever they like. I’d rather it be shared.</p>
<p>The ShareAlike aspect of the license means anything that is made, even commercially, also has to be ShareAlike. If a big company wants to use my work, they’re doing so while contributing to Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>“Being a part of a community also helps me to get a bit more traction for my freelance work. This model doesn’t take money away from you. It engages and connects people even more with what I do.”</p>
<p>Recently, Jem became a trustee of the <a href="http://creativefreedom.org.nz/" target="_blank">Creative Freedom Foundation</a>, joining other Creative Commons supporters, including Dan Untitled, <a title="Bronwyn Holloway-Smith" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2012/07/bronwyn-holloway-smith/" target="_blank">Bronwyn Holloway-Smith</a>, Matthew Holloway Smith and <a title="Luke Rowell DISASTERADIO" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2010/03/luke-rowell-disasteradio/" target="_blank">Luke Rowell of Disasteradio. </a></p>
<p>Jem’s next project idea is an interactive story that will use Creative Commons and Public Domain works as well as original illustrations. She will be blogging her progress <a href="http://jemshed.com/blog">over at Jemshed</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/">The Waikato Independent</a> is an online newspaper produced by journalism students at the Waikato Institute of Technology. All stories published on the site are made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives 3.0 Unported Licence.</a></p>
<p>The Waikato Independent is edited by <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/mediaarts/about/staff/charles-riddle.aspx">Charles Riddle, Lecturer in the School of Media Arts</a>. As Charles explains, “We use the Waikato Independent as a teaching tool. What we’re really interested in is getting our students’ work published as widely as possible.</p>
<p>“We put their work up under an open Creative Commons licence so that any of the community newspapers or websites that like the work can feel free to republish it, as long as they acknowledge the student as the author.</p>
<p>“The idea was that other media would pick it up, because the more widely a student can get published, the better it looks on their CV.”</p>
<p>Other media are paying attention. In February, <a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/2013/02/wintec-music-student-through-to-final-x-factor-audition/10909/">this story</a> about a local talent show contestant, written by Caitlin Wallace, was picked up by <a href="http://www.hamiltonnewslive.co.nz/news/wintec-student-amy-Maynard-Hassett-x-factor/1773541/">Hamilton News Live</a>; that story, in turn, was picked up by the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10868303.">New Zealand Herald</a>, New Zealand’s largest newspaper. “It can have that knock-on effect that we’re not even always aware off.”</p>
<p>Another recent example of reuse is <a href="http://www.waikatoindependent.co.nz/2013/02/cody-cooper-wins-motocross-second-round/10889/">this story</a> about a local Motocross rider, written by Corey Rosser, which was republished in <a href="http://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/39637-papamoa-man-wins-motox-round-2.html">Sun Live</a>.</p>
<p>Faculty at Wintec’s <a href="http://www.wintec.ac.nz/mediaarts/index.aspx">School of Media Arts</a> have introduced Creative Commons licensing as part of their wider focus on media law and copyright, specifically in their third-year Web Media course.</p>
<p>Most students, Charles says, are happy to give their work an open licence. Occasionally, a photographer will want to maintain ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright; otherwise, as Charles puts it, “we keep everything open.”</p>
<p>But what about when students graduate? Charles notes that his students may not always have a choice to use open licensing, especially if they work for more conventional news organisations. “But if they’re going to end up in Public Relations, using Creative Commons makes a lot of sense, really. We have quite a few that go into that. I would expect that they would write under Creative Commons.”</p>
<p>While noting that Creative Commons licensing is still a new concept for many, Charles points out that the licences have been a success for Wintec’s journalism students.</p>
<p>“It works fantastically for us.”</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Lillian Grace, founder of Wiki New Zealand, wants New Zealanders to make informed decisions. To this end, Lillian and others have uploaded a bunch of graphs and thematic maps based on public data to <a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/" target="_blank">wikinewzealand.org</a>, a new collaborative website.</p>
<p>While some of the data is used with permission, all of the content by Wiki New Zealand itself is made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand Licence</a>.</p>
<p>Lillian had the idea for Wiki New Zealand in February 2012, while working for the <a href="http://www.nzinstitute.org/" target="_blank">New Zealand Institute</a>. While giving talks to community and business groups, Lillian realised that,<del cite="mailto:Matt%20McGregor" datetime="2013-02-25T09:35"></del> “Every single issue that we addressed would have been easier to deal with if more people understood the basic facts.</p>
<p>“That’s one of the driving forces for me behind Wiki New Zealand. I’m concerned for New Zealand’s future and I think that the best chance we have of getting the best outcomes is if more people are informed and can make informed decisions.”</p>
<p>Lillian is especially interested in connecting people to public data in such a way that “doesn’t require them to have a great deal of time or skill.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen the power of informed decisions. I’ve seen the light go on in people when they learn something that they didn’t know.”</p>
<p>To help more New Zealander’s find out about their country, Lillian decided to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence to all Wiki New Zealand content. This licence allows users to share and adapt Wiki New Zealand content, as long as they provide attribution.</p>
<p>As Lillian puts it, “Creative Commons seemed like a natural fit because it seems like its purposes are very aligned with Wiki New Zealand’s purposes. I never actually considered not using it.”</p>
<p>“I really believe in sharing data and information. I like Creative Commons. Part of it is the language that it uses. It seems like its purpose is very clear. It’s a very sensible structure. It’s not scary to use. I felt very safe and responsible, like I was doing the right thing. This is very important when it comes to copyright, which can be quite daunting.”</p>
<p>Wiki New Zealand will soon add individual licensing statements for each graph, to ensure that users know exactly what they can do with Wiki New Zealand’s source data. While most content is sourced from New Zealand government agencies using Creative Commons licences, some of the content is made available under a more restrictive licensing agreement. “Some of the sources are fully open, like <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Statistics New Zealand</a>, but some sources only let their data be reproduced for free if it’s not for commercial use.”</p>
<p>Lillian is planning to introduce the full wiki functionality to the site in May. “When it’s a proper wiki, registered users will be able to add data for graphs themselves.”</p>
<p>“Imagine a scientist in the South Island collecting bacteria samples in fresh water—that’s great information. I’d be interested in knowing about that. But there has not been any mechanism to easily and regularly share such data with the public. Wiki New Zealand will enable them to submit their data in an online visual form that can be viewed and valued by the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“The process will be audited for content accuracy and impartiality, and the graphs are dynamically generated with a consistent look and feel to make them as easy as possible to make and digest.”</p>
<p>Lillian is hoping for a wide range of innovative reuse. “Anyone can do anything with the information Wiki New Zealand provides, as long as they abide by the licensing of the original sources. We’re providing our graphs in a range of different formats. Journalists can download the graphs and add their own branding, as long as they attribute the sources and Wiki New Zealand. They can repackage it how they like.”</p>
<p>To help promote the site, Lillian has introduced a ‘<a href="http://wikinewzealand.org/?cat=69" target="_blank">Know Your Country</a>’ feature, which tests users’ knowledge about New Zealand.</p>
<p>While the site will be extremely useful for teachers and journalists, Lillian hopes that it will appeal to all New Zealanders. “It’s hard to pinpoint specific users, as it really is for everyone.”</p>
<p>“I want it to infiltrate the culture, to make it cool to know your country, to make it normal to know your country.”</p>
