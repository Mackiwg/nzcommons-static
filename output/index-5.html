<h5>By Andrew Preston, co-founder of <a href="https://publons.com/" target="_blank">Publons</a>
</h5>
<p>A favourite ploy among unsolicited email advertising, that bane of the connected world, is the offer of instant degrees conferred by bogus institutions. Easy to get, sure, but unlikely to get you far in a competitive job market. In short, where you got your degree matters. Reputation is everything.</p>
<p>It’s the same in the world of academic publishing. Peer-review serves an essential role as the gatekeeper to research. Scientists evaluate the work of their peers to make sure the work is sound. Where you get your paper published matters too. This second layer of evaluation – and reputation – is added by the exclusivity (and impact factor) of the publication itself. The system is designed to give academics greater confidence in the published literature they choose to read.</p>
<p>It’s a system that has continued more or less unchanged and unchallenged for centuries. While, in the last few years, the internet has transformed virtually every publishing industry, there has been little experiment or innovation in the way academic research is communicated and evaluated.</p>
<p>The open access movement has challenged the traditional academic journal model on a single front: publication. While open access has made it easier for people to access a wider range of material, the issue of evaluation remains. In this critical area, traditional journals still hold all the cards.</p>
<p>This issue was highlighted by John Bohannon’s recent <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60" target="_blank">open access journal sting</a>. Bohannon submitted versions of a fake paper to 304 open access journals. This paper was so flawed that no journal should have accepted it, and yet more than half did!</p>
<p>It’s tempting to blame the open access model for this, but that’s not the problem. We need to focus on the evaluation process -- the peer-review. Reviewing is a necessary but thankless task. Reviewers get no credit for their time and effort. Journals struggle to find qualified reviewers who don’t have conflicts of interest. As a result, the review process can take months, slowing down the dissemination of research it is designed to facilitate. And, as Bohannon showed, that’s only if it’s done well.</p>
<p>The traditional approach serves to limit discussion and debate. There is no inherent reason that only one or two experts in a field should determine the validity of a paper, nor that their evaluations be kept secret. There is plenty of valuable knowledge out there in the heads of experts. We just need to figure out how to get it on the web, because if we succeed at that we strengthen the case for open access.</p>
<p>This starts with giving reviewers credit for their work. There are many ways to do this. One approach is to turn review into a publication itself. We’ve recently <a href="http://blog.publons.com/post/61380784056/announcing-doi-support-for-reviews" target="_blank">begun allocating</a> Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) to reviews performed on Publons.com, making them citable contributions to the scientific literature. While DOIs are standard for published articles and datasets, the application of DOIs to peer review is a world first. Effectively, this puts reviews on the same footing as publications. For academics, it means they can augment their publication record with a portfolio of reviews. This record can be used to strengthen applications for funding and jobs, and to collaborate in the academic community on a deeper level.</p>
<p>We’re not the only ones working to open up peer review. A number of interesting startups have begun to work in this space. PeerJ, PubPeer, Libre, F1000, Axios Review, PeerEvaluation, Rubriq, The Winnower, and Peerage of Science have all announced initiatives focused on improving review. These range from new publishing models, to post-publication review platforms, to peer-review as a service.</p>
<p>For an open access world to succeed we need our gatekeepers. We need to make sure they get ‘paid’. Giving peer reviewers recognition and credit for their indispensable contributions to science provides a greater incentive for them to contribute high-quality, timely reviews. The payoff for everyone is better debate, greater transparency and the enhanced reputation of open access material, leading ultimately to faster and better communication of science.</p>

<p>a place where a large amount of something is stored</p>
</dd>

<p>a person who possesses a lot of information, wisdom, etc. [1]</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p dir="ltr">At University repositories, this “something” is the knowledge we generate as a result of our academic research. My institution (University of Auckland), like other academic institutions around the country, has an “Institutional Repository”. It is called “<a href="https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/">Research Space</a>” and I suspect many of my colleagues might have never heard of it, and many might not know how to make use of it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Open Access is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access" target="_blank">usually described</a> as Gold (where the article is made accessible free of charge by the published) or Green (where some version of the manuscript, usually the peer reviewed version, is deposited by the author). I don’t personally find this distinction palatable, because the gold/green definition says more about mechanisms of delivery and less about liberties for reuse.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Those who know me also know that I prefer to think about Free Open Access (where the article is provided free of charge) and Libre Open Access (where the article is provided free of charge and there are few restrictions for reuse and repurposing). The copyright agreements we enter or the licence we choose when publishing open access defines where in the free-libre spectrum the article will sit.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If we wish to communicate our findings as widely as possible, shouldn’t we be opting for libre Open Access, where they can be reused, redistributed and repurposed? This week Daniel Mietchen, Raphael Wimmer and Nils Dagssonwas <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mindthebrain/2013/10/01/asap-awards-interview-with-daniel-mietchen/">received an award </a>for the work they did taking multimedia files that were part of libre Open Access literature and giving them a new life in WikiMedia, where they can be used to illustrate Wikipedia articles, used for educational purposes, etc.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, research publications do not solely serve the purpose of communicating our findings. They are also perhaps the most important contribution through which our worth as academics will be measured when we apply for a job, apply for promotion or seek to be granted tenure. We may be forgiven a lot by staffing committees, but never a poor publication record. We have been taught that how we brand our publications (where we publish them) will be a major factor for that assessment.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is not surprising then, that most of us will feel the need to do our best to place our article in the better branded journals, many of which will charge hefty Open Access fees, but will publish our article sometimes at a lower price or free of charge if we are willing to give our rights as authors away to them. Because this decision of where to publish is so intricately tied to career progress, the cultural inertia is hard to overcome.</p>

<p dir="ltr">These days, it is rare that I will find someone who doesn’t think that Open Access is “a good thing” (progress!). As soon as the term “Open Access” enters the discussion, however, I can see the $ shaped tears rolling down someone’s cheeks. Most frequently the discussion veers towards a standard list of “buts”.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Many of these “buts” are myths that seem to persist even in the face of evidence against them. Once they have the mindset that Open Access is not a “viable” alternative to be embraced by them, their immediate community of practice or even their institution, it does not seem to matter how much data is presented -- the response will inevitably be “Oh, ok. [pause] but…” If we cannot change scientists’ minds when confronting them with evidence, how will we be able to persuade our agencies and institutions? Until we overcome our apprehensions about open access, should we just stick to the status quo?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Institutional repositories provide a place where authors that choose to publish in the traditional way can deposit the peer-reviewed accepted article for anyone to access free of charge. All authors need to do is to contact their librarian and they will happily show them how to do this. In New Zealand, articles that are deposited in these repositories are given a second life, free of pay-walls and indexed by Google. In New Zealand the articles (and other research artifacts) are aggregated in <a href="http://nzresearch.org.nz/">http://nzresearch.org.nz/</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are several types of artifact types listed in nzreasearch (theses, conference posters, journal articles, patents, datasets, etc) and the site provides a really nice user interface to search for material. I could find at the time of writing 20,450 thesis listed, 15,132 research articles and 235 conference posters, for example. I doubt that these numbers (other than theses, perhaps) reflect the actual number of outputs from the NZ research sector. These numbers may instead indicate that more work needs to be done to encourage authors to make the deposition of their outputs in the repository a regular part of their workflow. I can’t help wondering whether, if we were asked to identify at our annual performance review, continuation, or promotions the proportion of our output that was deposited, we might see some progress.</p>

<p dir="ltr">My personal position is that research outputs that result from public funds should be made available under a copyright licence that minimises the restrictions on distribution and re-use. I also understand that authors may base their choice over where they publish on different kinds of reasons (some which I understand and other which I don’t). But even when authors choose to publish under traditional pay-walled schemes, the value of depositing in the institutional repository far outweigh the reasons not to do so.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This year’s Open Access Week focus is on “impact”, and for our outputs to have impact they first need to be read. <a href="https://twitter.com/brembs">Björn</a> Brems put it best when <a href="http://twitter.com/brembs/status/354486926562181120">he said</a>:</p>

<p dir="ltr">"No matter what field (or planet): limiting potential readership does not increase actual readership.”</p>

<h5>By Peter Binfield, co-founder of <a href="https://peerj.com)" target="_blank">PeerJ</a> and previously the Publisher of PLOS ONE.</h5>
<p><em>This post follows a talk at the University of British Columbia, which can be recorded and <a href="http://mediasitemob1.mediagroup.ubc.ca/Mediasite/Play/2cdc95b2d56a4c56a6606a6c116a58b01d" target="_blank">can be viewed here</a>.

The original dataset for this article, alongside the graphs and the slides, <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/MegaJournal_Publication_Data/833828" target="_blank">can be found at Figshare</a></em>.</p>
<p>‘MegaJournals’ are a reasonably recent phenomena in the history of scholarly publishing, however their popularity (as evidenced by the number of articles they publish) as well as their continuing growth (in title launches, and total output) are creating a new class of journal which has the potential to dramatically change the publishing landscape. This post, which is based on themes that I developed at the <a href="http://oaweek.open.ubc.ca/" target="_blank">UBC Open meeting</a> earlier this week, explores this phenomena and its potential for change.</p>
<p>A ‘megajournal’ is widely understood to be an online-only open access journal, that covers a very broad subject area and selects content based only on scientific and methodological soundness (or some variation on that statement), with a business model which allows each article to cover its own costs. With these attributes, megajournals are not limited in their potential output and as such are able to grow commensurate with any growth in submissions.</p>
<p>It is worth spending a little bit of time on the editorial criteria that these journals are applying. To be explicitly clear, these journals perform extremely rigorous peer-review (and several go so far as to publish the peer review process that each article went through). They do not, however, use notions of ‘impact’ to inform their decision to publish. They critically, and formally, peer-review articles to determine whether or not they deserve to join the scientific literature; they then allow the readership to make their own decisions about the interest level (to them) of any given article once it is published.</p>
<p>To put it another way, they make their publication decisions only on the basis of whether or not a submission deserves to join the scholarly literature. They believe that this approach puts science into the world more rapidly, more efficiently, and more transparently than the ‘traditional’ process of rejecting otherwise publishable work in an attempt to filter articles into specific journal titles. The result is a net benefit to academia.</p>
<p>PLOS ONE is the most visible success story in this category of journal. PLOS ONE is currently expected to publish more than 30,000 articles in 2013, approaching 3% of all STM articles published that year (PubMed indexes approximately 1 million new articles each year). Recognizing the success of this model, many other Publishing Companies and Academic Societies (such as Nature, Springer, SAGE, BioONE, PeerJ, BMJ, F1000, the American Institute of Physics, the American Society of Microbiology, the Genetics Society of America and so on) have launched similar journals and each of them are seeing their megajournals grow in volume, month on month (see the end of this post for a list of all known ‘megajournals’). Because of the size and the growth of titles like PLOS ONE (a growth which is shown in the graph below), much of the attention around the megajournal story has focused on these large broad scope titles.</p>
<p>Normally ‘mega’ is taken to mean ‘million’ and so ‘megajournal’ is clearly somewhat of a misnomer, even for PLOS ONE! Nonetheless, the term has stuck because of the sheer size of the most successful megajournals (titles which aim to publish across an extremely wide subject area).</p>
<p>However, if we put aside the issue of size, then there is another attribute of this type of journal which is important to consider – that of the editorial criteria that is applied. Megajournals such as PLOS ONE, Scientific Reports, BMJ Open, PeerJ and so on peer-review for scientific validity, but they do not pre-judge articles based on subjective notions of ‘impact’, ‘reach’, or ‘degree of advance.’ This editorial criteroa is <b>also </b>being applied by journals in much smaller, or more ‘niche’, subject areas. Clearly, a niche journal (for example, “<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/neurorobotics" target="_blank">Frontiers in Neurorobotics</a>”) that uses this editorial criteria would not expect to become extremely large (i.e. ‘mega’) due to the fact that it is in a somewhat small field.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we define this ‘class’ of journal as being based on the editorial criteria outlined above, then it is clear that both megajournals and many smaller ‘niche’ journals share the same class. The essential difference between them is simply whether or not they pre-judge the readership of their articles. A truly large megajournal does not need to do that (e.g. anything in the whole of biology, or the whole of medicine, or the whole of science is in scope), but one of the ‘smaller’ journals could reject an otherwise publishable article because it doesn’t fit their more limited subject-area scope (for example, the Frontiers in Neurorobotics journal would not publish a neuroeconomics article).</p>
<p>All of this is a long-winded way of saying that perhaps the term ‘megajournal’ (which refers to the potential size of the journal and only applies to the broad scope titles) is not the best one to help us understand the ‘megajournal’ phenomena. Another way to think about it is to look at the editorial criteria which is applied, regardless of the size (or scope) of the journal. If ‘megajournal’ is a misnomer in many respects, then what would be a better (yet still succinct and understandable) term? Some have suggested ‘non-selective’, or ‘impact neutral’, or ‘rigorous but inclusive review’ but none of these really capture the phenomena. Perhaps that is the topic for an OA Week Competition, or the comments area of this blog post…</p>
<p>When the definition of this journal class is expanded in this way, then it is clear that there are very large programs of journals which apply an editorial criteria similar to that of PLOS ONE – for example, the whole of the “Frontiers In…” series of journals, all of the BMC Series journals (which make up approximately half of the output of BioMed Central), as well as and titles making up approximately 1/3 of the output of Hindawi. To be fair, this point has been made in the past (e.g. by Matt Cockerill and Paul Peters at the <a href="http://river-valley.tv/conferences/coasp-2011" target="_blank">COASP meeting in 2011</a>), but it is my belief that most people’s attention has been focused on PLOS ONE, and similar ‘broad scope’ launches such as Scientific Reports, BMJ Open or PeerJ, with the result that the simultaneous rise of many other ‘impact neutral’ journals has perhaps been overlooked.</p>
<p>Regardless of name, or type, another defining characteristic of these journals is the fact that almost without fail, all journals using this editorial model grow in output, month on month. The overall effect is that the output of the entire class of journals is growing extremely rapidly, and in fact much more significantly than might have been assumed if you simply look at the PLOS ONE output. An illustrative graph is shown below, using data which was compiled with the input of most of the publishers of each of the titles listed in the appendix to this post.</p>
<p>So this class of journal is clearly very successful and rapidly growing. In 2012 alone, as can be seen from the graph, approximately 47,000 articles were published using this editorial model, and by extrapolation 2013 could see as many as 75,000 articles published in a model which intentionally makes no ‘pre-publication’ judgments of their significance / impact / degree of advance etc. (note: 75,000 articles is approximately 8% of all STM journal output). And this growth is being driven by a genuine author desire – each of these growing publications have clearly been able to fill a previously unmet need for their authors to the extent that they are flocking to the model, and reporting extremely positive experiences.</p>
<h5><b>But Have They ‘Changed Everything’?</b></h5>

<p>The fact that a journal does not use ‘significance’, ‘impact’, or ‘degree of advance’ to determine whether an article should be published does not mean that those aspects are not important (it is simply that they aren’t important to the decision to publish). If subjective filtering (on whatever criteria) has not happened ‘pre-publication’ for as much as 8% of the academic corpus, then clearly the community needs to apply new tools ‘post publication’ to try to provide these types of signals based on the reception of the article in the real world. To take this a step further, it is also becoming apparent that these journals are changing the way that people think about articles themselves - increasingly, people are coming to understand that the article itself is more important than the journal in which it happens to be published.</p>
<p>This is one of the key reasons, I believe, that we are currently seeing such an explosion in interest in ‘altmetrics’ and why this field is becoming more mainstream. For example, at a recent PLOS-sponsored <a href="http://article-level-metrics.plos.org/alm-workshop-2013/" target="_blank">ALM meeting</a>, representatives from publishers such as Elsevier and Springer, Universities such as Harvard and funders such as Wellcome Trust and Sloan were present. In recent years, we have also seen the creation of article-level metrics programs at many publishers (for example PLOS, and Frontiers), as well as the formation of several start-up companies in the ‘alt-metric’ space such as <a href="http://impactstory.org/" target="_blank">Impact Story</a>, <a href="http://www.altmetric.com/" target="_blank">Altmetric</a>, and <a href="http://www.plumanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Plum Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Another way in which these journals are causing changes in the publishing world is their ability to publish negative results, or replication studies. Historically, it has been very hard to get studies of this nature published; however, if they had been published, then the community would not need to waste time repeating the mistakes that others had made before (but not made public). These journals are ideal venues for this kind of material. As more and more articles of this type are published, the net benefit to the academic community will be great and much time and energy will be saved.</p>
<p>But perhaps most importantly, as implied at the start of this post, the existence of these journals contributes to a considerable net increase in the speed and efficiency of the overall publishing ecosystem. Traditionally an article might be sent to a ‘first choice’ journal and even if it were publishable it could be rejected based on reasons such as ‘lack of interest’ or ‘insufficient advance in the field’ or ‘lack of novelty‘. That article will have spent weeks or months being peer reviewed, and once rejected it will simply be sent by the authors to their ‘second choice’ journal, where it will again spend weeks or months in the process, and be evaluated again by new peer reviewers (for examples, see <a href="http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/rejections" target="_blank">this collection of ‘serial rejections</a>’).</p>
<p>Eventually the article will be published (unless the authors give up in despair, which many do), but in the intervening time it will have been delayed by months or years, and it will have wasted the time of multiple reviewers and editors. And all of this time and energy will have been spent in the name of ‘filtering’ the article into a specific journal ‘bucket’. It has been estimated by <a href="http://blog.rubriq.com/2013/06/03/how-we-found-15-million-hours-of-lost-time/" target="_blank">Rubriq</a> that as many as 15 million hours a year are wasted on ‘redundant review’.</p>
<p>By contrast, if an article is peer-reviewed once in a megajournal model, and then (dependent on suitable revisions) it is published, then that article will have entered the public sphere much more rapidly and without wasting the time of additional ‘redundant’ reviewers. If all articles were published in this model then the net benefit to academia (due to increased speed to publication, and reduced duplication of effort by reviewers to name just two effects) would be dramatic.</p>
<p>As Open Access itself grows in importance, we can expect to see more journals of this type launched; however, it is apparent that the growth of this model cannot continue indefinitely. If PLOS ONE already publishes 3% (and growing) of the STM literature, then it does not take many journals (or programs of journals) publishing at that scale before a <b>significant</b> proportion of the scholarly literature is being published in this way with all the advantages that this entails. Put simply, as more and more content is published using this kind of editorial model, then the net result will be that:</p>
<ul>
<li>New business models, new innovations and new thinking are able to flourish in a new publication ecosystem;</li>

    <li>‘Mistakes’ or ‘non-results’(so called ‘negative results’) are actually reported, saving future researchers time, energy, and resources;</li>

    <li>Previously ‘uninteresting’ results can now be reported, providing the potential to incrementally build on these ‘micro findings’;</li>

    <li>Reporting standards can be more easily standardized and the levels more easily raised;</li>

    <li>Less time is wasted by multiple reviewers on the same content;</li>

    <li>The process of publication is made more transparent and fair for the author;</li>

    <li>Better methods of filtering, evaluating and sorting publications will evolve; and finally,</li>

    <li>Science will be published more rapidly, saving author time and improving the overall speed of discovery.</li>

</ul>
<p>And when that happens, then I think it is fair to say that the rise of this editorial model will have changed everything…</p>

<strong>By Deborah Fitchett, Digital Access Coordinator at Lincoln University.
<p></p></strong>
<p>The movement to open up research data is gaining momentum. Both publishers and funders are starting to require researchers to publish their data at the same time as the results and conclusions they've derived from it. Most recently, the <a href="http://www.msi.govt.nz/assets/Update-me/National-Science-Challenges/Request-for-proposals/RfP-1st-tranche-Oct-2013.pdf">National Science Challenges' Request for Proposals (pdf)</a> requires fundees to explain how they will comply with the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing Framework</a> and provide for access to and re-use of data generated (p.13).</p>
<p><strong>Publishing data</strong></p>
<p>Because publication of research data is still relatively new, it looks complicated and scary. And it can be complicated if you want it to be. A really large project might make it worth creating its own website to host the resulting dataset(s) and present them in a custom set of interfaces. (The National Science Challenges let you apply funding to provide for access to and re-use of data.) Look at <a href="http://geonet.org.nz/">GeoNet</a> (on the off-chance you haven't already!) for an example: it provides raw data from the quake drums, and both initial and confirmed calculations about the size and location of quakes. Data is presented pre-digested on maps for the casual visitor, and in <a href="http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/appdata/Earthquake+Web+Feature+Service">open data formats</a> for the more sophisticated reuser.</p>
<p>But publication can also be as easy as spending a minute creating a <a href="http://figshare.com/">figShare</a> account and another minute uploading your file and adding a title and subject keywords. Click a button and your data has a permanent home and DOI.</p>
<p>Perhaps midway are subject-specific repositories (over 600 listed on <a href="http://www.re3data.org/">re3data</a> alone): these tend to have more metadata/documentation requirements or other forms of quality control. <a href="http://datadryad.com/">Dryad</a> has recently instigated a small data publishing charge. A number of journals are paying this charge for their authors: perhaps for the good of science, perhaps recognising that the <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/175/">data publication citation advantage</a> is good for their impact factors.</p>
<p><strong>Open data</strong></p>
<p>Publishing is a good start, but it's not the same as making the data open for reuse. Peter Desmet's <a href="http://peterdesmet.com/posts/illegal-bullfrogs.html">illegal bullfrogs</a> demonstrates how we lose out when data reuse is restricted, whether by intent or neglect.</p>
<p>Fortuitously a lot of data publication venues support or require published data to be open data. FigShare and Dryad for example both require a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">Creative Commons Zero</a> licence. This lets people use the data in any application without even the need for attribution -- useful if their application pulls together data from dozens, hundreds, or thousands of sources.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this doesn't affect the scholarly norm of citing your sources, any more than the expiration of copyright means you no longer need to cite Aristotle, Murasaki, or Marie Curie. <a href="http://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a>, among many others, is working on data citation standards, but the main principle is that data should be cited just as articles and books are.</p>
<p><strong>Better data</strong></p>
<p>So publishing data is easy, and publishing data openly is easy. Publishing open data <em>well</em> is the hard thing -- just as it is for any human skill or endeavour. You start with the basics and level up according to your capacity and needs. The <a href="https://certificates.theodi.org/">ODI Open Data Certification process</a> is a friendly way both to recognise what level you're at and to let you know what direction you can develop in next.</p>
<p>You might, for example, start by publishing in a proprietary format like Excel, then later level up to publishing in the open CSV format, or machine-readable XML, or a chart with the data embedded behind it using a tool like <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/07/19/creating-charts-with-datawrapper/">Datawrapper</a>, or a bundle of formats for different uses plus interactive visualisations.</p>
<p>Your first time, you might realise you don't have consent from your human participants to publish their data, so limit yourself to publishing only the data gathered by other means -- then on your next research project you might plan for data publication right from the ethics approval stage.</p>
<p><strong>Planning for data</strong></p>
<p>The words "Data Management Plan" strike fear in the researcher's heart, conjuring up the spectre of voluminous forms full of bureacratese and technical specifications. But all it means is to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>what data you intend to gather;</li>

    <li>how you'll analyse and document it;</li>

    <li>what ethical questions it raises and how you'll deal with those;</li>

    <li>how you'll store it safely and securely while you're carrying out your research;</li>

    <li>and what you'll do with it afterwards -- whether to publish all or part of it, archive it privately for a period, or in some cases destroy it.</li>

</ul>
<p>The UK's Digital Curation Centre's <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP-checklist-post-consultation-v2.pdf">2009 checklist for a data management plan (pdf)</a> consisted of over 80 questions - but <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf">its most recent version (pdf)</a> has only 24 (or <a href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/node/10020">just 13, depending how you count</a>). The idea is simply to make sure you've thought about these things before beginning your project, so you don't get caught by surprise when the journal you submit to at the end of it requires you to publish your data.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect data</strong></p>
<p>There's no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>The best data</strong></p>
<p>Ranganathan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_laws_of_library_science">Five Laws of Library Science</a> could easily be reapplied here, beginning: Data is for use.</p>
<p>The best data is the data that someone finds when they need it. They might have to convert it or tidy it or reanalyse it -- but if they have the data they can do all these things.</p>
<p>If you can thoroughly document your data, do; but if not, don't let that stop you putting your data up. If you can convert it into an open machine-readable format, do; but if not, don't let that be why it languishes on your hard drive. If you can publish all your data under a Creative Commons Zero licence, do; but if not, publish some of it, under whatever licence you can.</p>
<p>Every dataset you publish, no matter how small or incomplete or imperfect, is a wheel someone else doesn't have to reinvent. Start small, but start; and keep the wheels of science turning.</p>

<h5>By Dr Danny Kingsley</h5>
<p>This has been a big year for open access around the world, and developments in Australia have moved apace.</p>
<p>Two things happened on the first of January 2013 – the Australian Research Council (ARC) announced their <a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/applicants/open_access.htm" target="_blank">open access policy</a> and the <a href="http://aoasg.org.au" target="_blank">Australian Open Access Support Group</a> (AOASG) began operations (disclaimer – I work as the Executive Officer for the AOASG).</p>
<h5>Funding policies</h5>

<p>The ARC policy is very similar to the <a href="http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/grants/policy/dissemination-research-findings" target="_blank">policy</a> introduced on 1 July 2012 by the Australia’s other government funding body – the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/resources/comparison-of-arc-nhmrc-policies/" target="_blank">Both policies require</a> that the Chief Investigators for funded projects should add metadata about their publications to their institutional repositories at the time of acceptance. There should be a link to the open access version within 12 months of publication. Neither policy advocates a particular method of achieving open access, and both policies specifically do not require payment for open access. However both organisations allow use of grant funding to pay for publication.</p>
<p>These policies stand out because they specifically look to use the established infrastructure in Australia. All Australian universities, (and many other institutions) have <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/open-access-repositories-at-australian-institutions/." target="_blank">established an institutional repository</a>  Generally to date Australia has enjoyed strong <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/03/19/centrally-supported-open-access-initiatives-in-australia/" target="_blank">commitment and support from the government</a> to develop infrastructure for open access.</p>
<p>At an Open Access Week event organised by the AOASG, the CEOs of both the ARC and the NHMRC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Kcj8j3LyBQ" target="_blank">spoke about these policies.</a> They noted that given the speed of change in scholarly communication it is almost impossible to know what the open access agenda will look like in five years time. For this reason neither the NHMRC nor the ARC wish to be prescriptive about how to implement their policies. They did note that while there are no current plans to withhold future grants from researchers that do not comply with the policies, this could become the case into the future.</p>
<h5>Events and activities</h5>

<p>That was one of many <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/oawk-events-2013/" target="_blank">OAWk events</a> being held in Australia in 2013, which has shaped up to be the largest yet. Every state and territory is hosting events with more than half the country’s universities participating.</p>
<p>The week following OAWk will see a large open access-themed conference – the <a href="http://www.oar2013.qut.edu.au" target="_blank">Open Access and Research Conference</a> held at QUT from 30 October to 1 November. This event will feature many high-profile international speakers.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2013 the <a href="http://www.humanities.org.au/About/AlliedOrganisations/NationalScholarlyCommunicationsForum.aspx" target="_blank">National Scholarly Communication Forum</a> was held, addressing the topic “Open Access Research Issues in the Humanities and Social Sciences”. A full run down of the presentations, themes and readings is <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/05/16/notes-from-the-national-scholarly-communication-forum-may-3-2013/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Informing the discussion</h5>

<p>Throughout the year the AOASG has worked towards its goal of informing and encouraging the discussion around open access. The primary output of the group has been the development of the AOASG webpage. This consists of a combination of information about open access specific to Australia, links to useful resources, and discussion points about events in the open access space both in Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>The site has had over 26,000 visitors since going live in February. An analysis of page statistics indicates a strong interest in practitioner issues. The most popular blog has been “<a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/04/10/so-you-want-people-to-read-your-thesis/" target="_blank">So you want people to read your thesis?</a>”, followed by “<a href="http://aoasg.org.au/2013/03/25/journal-editors-take-note-you-have-the-power/" target="_blank">Journal editors take note – you have the power</a>". The most popular webpage (apart from the homepage) is the <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/open-access-in-action/australian-oa-journals/" target="_blank">list of Australian OA journals</a>. The website also contains several graphics including <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/how-to-make-research-oa/" target="_blank">posters</a> and <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/resources/policy-compliance-decision-tree/" target="_blank">flowcharts</a> that are available for download under CC-BY license.</p>
<p>The Australian and New Zealand repository community has been fortunate to have a strong community of practice which developed over several years through discussion lists and community days organised through the CAUL Australasian Institutional Repository Support Service (CAIRSS). While CAIRSS no longer exists, the Council of Australian University Librarians (<a href="http://www.caul.edu.au" target="_blank">CAUL</a>) has continued to support these important services.</p>
<p>To complement this community, AOASG started the <a href="http://mailman.anu.edu.au/mailman/listinfo/australian_oa_community" target="_blank">Australian Open Access Community Discussion List</a> which pleasingly has had a strong uptake. Over 200 people have joined the list, representing a wide range of backgrounds. While 72% of the members are library-associated, a significant number of these are from research institutions outside the university sector. We have a positive interest from researchers, with many joining the list. There has also been some international interest – with members from India, Japan and Singapore plus several from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Twitter has been a very useful way to share the vast amount of developments, publications, policies and resources that are part of the open access area. The Twitter feed @openaccess_oz has sent over 1,200 notifications during the year. Followers come from all over the world.</p>
<p>Possibly the most positive sign for open access in Australia is the increasing number of policies in institutions. The AOASG began with representatives from six universities with open access policies. During the year more have been announced and it is anticipated that others are intending to during or around OAWk. There is a full list of Australian OA policies <a href="http://aoasg.org.au/resources/" target="_blank">here</a>. The AOASG is looking to expand its membership for 2014, which is shaping to be an even bigger year for open access in Australia.</p>

<em>Recently, I was lucky enough to travel to Buenos Aires to take part in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013" target="_blank">Creative Commons Global Summit</a>, which was attended by over 250 delegates from 80 countries.
<p></p></em>
<h5>Background: The 2nd Global Conference on IP and the Public Interest</h5>

<p>Let’s begin with some background: In 2012, a heap of Creative Commons affiliates attended the <a href="http://www.global-congress.org/" target="_blank">2nd Global Congress on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest</a> in Rio de Janeiro, an event aimed at building a broad network of scholars and advocates to promote IP policy reform. In fact, as Creative Commons Netherlands Public Lead Paul Keller writes<a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank"> in his blog post at Kennisland</a>, “Creative Commons affiliate teams formed the biggest contingent of participants from a single community there."</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise. As a community, <em>Recently, I was lucky enough to travel to Buenos Aires to take part in the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2013" target="_blank">Creative Commons Global Summit</a>, which was attended by over 250 delegates from 80 countries. This is the first in a series of posts summarising and reflecting on some of the issues that were raised during the Summit. </em></p>
<h5>Background: The 2nd Global Conference on IP and the Public Interest</h5>

<p>Let’s begin with some background: In 2012, a heap of Creative Commons affiliates attended the <a href="http://www.global-congress.org/" target="_blank">2nd Global Congress on Intellectual Property and the Public Interest</a> in Rio de Janeiro, an event aimed at building a broad network of scholars and advocates to promote IP policy reform. In fact, as Creative Commons Netherlands Public Lead Paul Keller writes<a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank"> in his blog post at Kennisland</a>, “Creative Commons affiliate teams formed the biggest contingent of participants from a single community there."</p>
<p>This should come as no surprise. As a community, Creative Commons affiliates are involved with a broad range of public interest projects, including open government, open education, open cultural heritage, open science -- and, as it happens, copyright reform.</p>
<p>The problem is that Creative Commons affiliates don't tend to advocate for copyright reform <em>as</em> Creative Commons affiliates. In fact, many affiliates feel as if they have to preface any public statement for reform -- even pragmatic statements against copyright extension or for broad fair use provisions -- by stating that they do not speak 'for' their respective Creative Commons project.</p>
<p>This meant that despite being the largest community at the conference, "we did not have a position on what we were doing there as Creative Commons."</p>
<h5>The Status Quo</h5>

<p>"I cannot count," Paul writes, "how often I have prefaced contributions to discussions by stating that 'I am not making this point with my CC hat on.'" This sounds like -- and is -- a technicality, though it's a technicality that allows the global Creative Commons project to focus on its core role: that is, to act as a steward for the global commons.</p>
<p>The concern for many is that CC's participation in copyright reform would weaken its capacity to work with public agencies to open up publicly funded copyright works. This, as it happens, is the core work of just about every Creative Commons project on the planet.</p>
<p>The other core issue is that Creative Commons HQ, under the US tax code, is not allowed to engage in lobbying activities. While CC affiliates are not bound by this restriction, the general wariness against participating in activities that could be construed as 'lobbying' remains.</p>
<p>The debate continues. However, many affiliates agree that the drive for a 'global commons'and the drive for copyright reform are one and the same, and that it no longer makes sense to separate the two.</p>
<h5>Copyright Reform at the Creative Commons Global Summit</h5>

<p>In order to solicit a broad discussion on the issue, Paul Keller, along with CCHQ and other leading Creative Commons affiliates, organised a mini-conference before the official CC Summit proceedings. Expecting around two dozen people to sign-up, the 'mini-conference' swelled to over 100 attendees, with representatives from most CC affiliates and many related organisations, such as Wikimedia, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Open Knowledge Foundation and the Public Library of Science. <em></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Opening the copyright reform meeting, Paul articulated two compelling reasons for the Creative Commons community to engage in reform activities, both of which were echoed by many other affiliate organisations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many affiliates have noticed anti-reform lobbyists using the success of Creative Commons as an argument <em>against</em> copyright reform. In essence, this argument goes something like, 'Creative Commons is a success, therefore we should make copyright more restrictive.' At the very least, Creative Commons needs to clarify that it does not support this argument.</li>

    <li>There are many different routes to a richer, more vibrant commons, and for some materials, Creative Commons is not the most appropriate route to take. Paul refers to <a href="http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2013/article_0017.html" target="_blank">the recent WIPO treaty for the visually impaired</a>, which was a victory for the commons, but not a victory that would have been won by advocating for open licensing. You can read a Paul's argument <a href="http://www.kennisland.nl/filter/nieuws/creative-commons-en-de-modernisering-van-het-auteursrecht" target="_blank">in full here</a>.</li>

</ol>
<p>While there was general agreement about the need for CCHQ to clarify its position, it was clear that each CC affiliate was going to have to navigate these waters for itself, according to its local challenges and opportunities -- including, of course, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

<h5>By Josh Wright</h5>
<p><em>In June 2011, Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) launched the </em><a href="http://data.linz.govt.nz/"><em>LINZ Data Service</em></a><em> (LDS), a web-based tool which allows users to map and download LINZ data. LDS licences most of its data under a </em><a href="http://http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"><em>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>We sat down and had a chat with Manager Jeremy Palmer and Planning and Support Advisor Vicki Lindsay to talk about where the LDS came from, what it’s currently doing, and where it might be headed in the future.</em></p>
<p>LDS was born, Jeremy says, out of the need to do two things: “first, to drive innovation in the private sector to get better reuse of our data, and second, to drive efficiencies within government agencies.” One of the operation’s key requirements, Jeremy says, was the open licensing of data.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://nzgoal.info/">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing</a> (NZGOAL) framework, deciding to license with Creative Commons was a relatively simple process. “We brought NZGOAL into the equation early on, which allowed us to analyse our methods of licensing—previously, each dataset had its own terms, conditions and restrictions based on various levels of complex copyright.”</p>
<p>"We concluded pretty quickly that we could relicense most of our datasets under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences—bar a few which have legal restrictions on them.”</p>
<p>Vicki described the LDS experience as a “bit of a test pilot” for the implementation of the NZGOAL framework. “It was really good for us because we didn’t need to develop any licences, but could adopt a licence recognised both nationally and internationally.”</p>
<p>LINZ’s Chief Executive at the time, Colin MacDonald, was intimately involved in the cross-government programme for data and information re-use. The adoption of the NZGOAL framework was strategic decision on LINZ’s part - an opportunity for LINZ to show leadership in the open data space. Jeremy says that stakeholders and partners that contributed to the design of the service would also chip in with advice: “we were working in partnership with <a href="http://koordinates.com/">Koordinates</a>, who provided the technology for LDS and who are heavily involved in the open data movement.”</p>
<p>Before the launch of the LDS, access to LINZ datasets was primarily done through manual requests and provided on DVDs—a “labour-intensive” and time consuming process. While some of these ‘legacy services’ are running alongside the LDS currently, Vicki notes they will be streamlined into the LDS in the long term. As with any major change in service delivery, the transition can take time to negotiate.</p>
<p>But Jeremy says the change has been for the best: “the service is a professional service, enabling easy online access to our data via a sophisticated set of tools and functionality. In a typical week, LDS gets upwards of 500 file downloads of our datasets—which is much, much more than when our data distribution was manually administered.”</p>
<p>Not only has opening the datasets increased usage in numbers, it’s also invited a more diverse user-base, says Vicki. “Because it’s much more accessible now, and free to access, we are seeing our customer base grow to include smaller organisations that may not have used LINZ data before , whereas customers who used our previous services were generally professional organisations who could consume that complex data quite easily.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“It was generally very complex, so it was quite a shift in philosophy for us to go from being a raw bulk data distributor to taking that data and making it accessible to that a wider range of users” adds Jeremy.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Landscape architect Nigel Cowburn, of Growplan Ltd., uses the LDS’ datasets in order to arrive at worksites to meet clients “fully armed” with information about the property and landscape as it currently exists. He says the LDS enables him to prepare ahead of time. “It’s free and reliable, and helps me ask intelligent questions,” Nigel says. “It makes the remote part of my work possible, as I have a good idea of the landscape before I go—the more information I can access online, the better.”</p>

<p>LDS is frequently updated to meet the needs of its customers. But as with any large operation, the project didn’t come without its obstacles. “The release and simplification of large datasets were a big challenge for us to manage—from the outset, however, by partnering with Koordinates, they had already solved some of the issues..”</p>
<p>Jeremy notes that the service is really showing results. The number of registered users of the LINZ Data Service, currently standing at almost 6.500, continues to climb by an impressive 300 users every month. These customers, spanning government, geospatial, survey, utility, contracting, and engineering sectors and beyond, are using the LINZ Data Service to realise efficiencies, innovation and improved decision-making.</p>
<p>The LDS’ efforts haven’t gone unrecognised. LINZ was the recipient of the <em>JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence</em> at the <a href="http://www.spatialbusiness.org/aus/Upcoming-Events/Asia-Pacific-Spatial-Excellence-Awards">Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards</a>—the premier forum for recognising the spatial information industry’s top performers. Of the award, <a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/news-publications-and-consultations/news-and-notices/lds-named-asia-pacific%E2%80%99s-best-of-the-best">LINZ Chief Executive Peter Mersi</a> says “it is recognition of the highest order of the value of developing and implementing an easy-to-use geospatial data sharing service.” Mersi says LDS has played a part in “revolutionising the way people can discover, use and share New Zealand public data.”</p>
<p>Jeremy notes that Australians are “envious of the openness of the whole ecosystem” that LDS uses. “In Australia, the multiple levels of government have imposed a model where they’re trying to still do cost recovery for their assets. The fact that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up.”</p>
<p>Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies considering using open licencing, both Jeremy and Vicki are supportive of the measures. “I’d definitely recommend opening access to public, non -private information across government. If there’s a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the data out there.”</p>

<h5>By Josh Wright</h5>
<p>On his blog <a href="http://davegiles.blogspot.co.nz/2012/05/disappearing-historical-data.html"><em>Econometrics Beat</em></a>,Canadian economist David E Giles describes the open presentation of <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/">Statistics New Zealand</a>’s (SNZ) data online: “<em>This isn’t just a collection of boring spreadsheets. It’s a valuable and serious piece of data research</em>.”</p>
<p>He’s right—SNZ have been pioneers in maximising transparency through the open licensing of many of their datasets, which they release online through web-based applications <em>NZ.Stat</em> and <em>Infoshare.</em> While SNZ is best known to the public for their management of the census, their remit stretches beyond just this—and they use open licences on much of their data to ensure it has maximum reach.</p>
<p>The logic for SNZ is simple. Releasing data in an open framework helps for a range of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it makes it easier for government agencies to work together;</li>

    <li>it reduces the cost of providing an existing government service, with decreased paperwork and hoops to jump through;</li>

    <li>it maximises access and visibility to users, attracting new customers;</li>

    <li>and it reduces the cost of accessing and processing information for existing users.</li>

</ul>
<p>The <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/programmes/open-and-transparent-government/open-data-case-studies/">Open Government Information and Data Re-use Work Programme</a> has written up some case studies about how SNZ has released data in an open format. Given these case studies are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licences themselves, we thought it would be good to summarise them for a wider public audience.</p>
<p><strong>Census data</strong></p>
<p>Census data is what most of the public know SNZ for. Through their website, SNZ has released blocks of census data from 1996, 2001, and 2006 under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licences. These datasets—which include information on age, ethnicity, income, workplace, dwelling size and geography—can be organised online and then downloaded in a variety of formats for remix and re-use.</p>
<p>A dedicated team works to develop Census datasets for phased release. The team is constantly looking for ways to improve: for each new census recorded, changes and improvements in the range of datasets available are made based on user feedback. While the 2011 Census was delayed because of the Christchurch earthquake, data from this year’s Census will be available from December onwards.</p>
<p><strong>Economic indicators data</strong></p>
<p>SNZ also release economic datasets, which detail New Zealand’s gross domestic product, consumer price index, balance of payments, and productivity—all on a quarterly basis. This data is freely available for public and business through web-based tools that aid in the preparation and formatting of datasets for open use.</p>
<p>Opening economic indicator data has been a great step for SNZ’s visibility and usefulness to New Zealand. Businesses, government agencies, community organisations, and research institutions use the data to direct their research and development and to inform their decision-making at all levels—making New Zealand a savvier, better-informed, and ultimately more prosperous place to live.</p>
<p><strong>‘Tier 1’ statistics</strong></p>
<p>These statistics, released online through SNZ’s web-based applications, describe New Zealand’s economy, environment, population, society, culture, international relations, and civil and political rights. Government, businesses, and members of the public use these statistics to make informed decisions and monitor the state and progress of New Zealand.</p>
<p>So—what makes them ‘Tier 1’? They are consistent, of high quality, and have integrity. This is why they are the priority for the government’s statistical production. Tier 1 statistics are optimal for public, wide use, which is why it’s important that they are published in a way that allows for equal and open access. Like the other data services, Tier 1 statistics are delivered through a broad range of formats, including in reports, as aggregate data, and (with some restrictions) as microdata.</p>
<p><strong>How is it all released?</strong></p>
<p>In order to actually get data from their systems into customers’ hands, SNZ use their online data tools <em>Infoshare </em>and <em>NZ.Stat</em>, which were implemented through the Making Information Freely Available programme in 2008-09. <em>Infoshare</em>, designed in consultation with users to facilitate open databases, was the successor to <em>INFOS</em>, a closed subscription system that had only 90 consistent subscribers.</p>
<p>SNZ’s decision to open up their data through web-based data retrieval applications has seen user numbers increase from 90 to over 100,000 in 2011-12. Not only are these web-based applications user-friendly, they allow customers to organise their data to suit them—presenting information in different formats to meet the needs of a diversity of users.</p>
<p>We think this is a pretty neat use of open licensing—kudos to SNZ for showing the initiative!</p>

<h5>By Holly Grover</h5>
<p>In July 2009, the <a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/index.html" target="_blank">Ministry for the Environment</a> started to release its datasets under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution</a> licence, becoming one of the first New Zealand government agencies to do so.</p>
<p>The process started in 2007, when MfE found themselves with a range of expiring license agreements for the distribution of some of their datasets. These databases were distributed and managed by a third party, who would charge a fee, register users, then get people to sign a license agreement before receiving the data. It was, in the words of Karl Majorhazi GISP-AP – Senior Analyst, simply “the way things were done.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not what we wanted,” Karl explains, “because when you invest in a database, the value of that is related to the number of users and uses it’s put to. So in the five years that that distribution agreement had been running, there were 99 registered users. And when you are looking to fund an update and you’ve only got 99 users it doesn’t make the maths look good.”</p>
<p>At this time, the State Services Commission was beginning to look into the use of Creative Commons licenses. Karl sat in on SSC meeting with<a href="http://creativecommons.org.au/" target="_blank"> Creative Commons Australia</a> Project Lead Anne Fitzgerald, of the Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Law.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, the decision to move to Creative Commons licensing was rather straightforward. “We tested it out, got some advice on what it is, what it could be used for what it couldn’t, and eventually we came to the decision that this was the way to go.”</p>
<p>The second piece of the puzzle was an online data platform <a href="http://koordinates.com/layer/4317-environmental-limiting-factors/#/maps/environment/">Koordinates</a>, launched only a few months earlier, which provided an easy way to search, sort, and share the datasets.</p>
<p>The Ministry’s first release was on 1 July 2009, and it didn’t take long for the data to be used in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>“We had a request from a company in Germany who were making a flight simulator app for the iPhone, who wanted to know if they could use the Landcover database in their system to give a more feature rich environment for anyone that’s flying over the country.” Of course, they didn’t need to ask as, unlike past arrangements, “the license terms and conditions mean there’s no reason why they can’t.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/land/land-cover-dbase/" target="_blank">The Landcover database</a> went from 99 registered users to over 2000 downloads, as researchers, students and members of the public began to freely use the data.</p>
<p>Recently, Karl had a phone call from someone “who was looking at the watershed data that we provide as part of the Marine Environment Classification. He was using that for a search and rescue project, using the watersheds to determine where people get lost and found. That’s one of these unintended reuses that you don’t plan for when you are developing this database.”</p>
<p>Karl notes that one of the downsides of open data platforms is that you are unable to track users. Nevertheless, there have been several other exciting examples of high-value reuse of Ministry for the Environment data.</p>
<p>As Karl explains, “I turned up at a seminar and a colleague of mine came bounding over from the other side of the room with a big smile on his face and said ‘I’ve got a good news story for you!’ He operates a small consultancy and he was asked to turn around a quick analysis for parliament on how much it would roughly cost to dig trenches along side roads motorways to lay broadband cable.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t get access to the soil information from Landcare at the time because it was it was under wraps commercially, but he found a piece of research that tied to it the attributes in the Land Environment dataset. He managed to download that dataset, use it in his analysis and turn that job around.”</p>
<p>“That is a case where people could do the job they needed to do because the data was already there – it’s an argument for being proactive, not waiting until somebody requests it.”</p>
