<h5>By Matt McGregor</h5>
<p><a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Jon Lemmon</a> is a songwriter and musician based in Wellington, New Zealand. His latest album, Demos/Sketches, was released in 2011 under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commerical 3.0 licence</a>.</p>
<p>Jon used the same licence to release his other albums, including<a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/singles-2010" target="_blank"> Singles</a>, <a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/kindling-ep" target="_blank">Kindling EP</a> and <a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/track/steppenwolf-pg-247-wet-wings-remix" target="_blank">Steppenwolf</a>, also available for free download.</p>
<p>As Jon puts it, he uses Creative Commons for “everything, really. I’m a bedroom producer, and do all of it on my computer—recording, writing songs, singing, all of that—and to me, it didn’t really ever seem like a question whether or not I’d use Creative Commons.”</p>
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1201170730/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" width="400" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Jon was encouraged to use Creative Commons licensing by VBC radio host Kim Wheatley, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CompulsoryEx/info?ref=stream" target="_blank">host of Compulsory Ecstasy</a>, who was living with Jon at the time. Kim was reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a> and saw open licensing as an interesting wayfor Jon to release his music.</p>
<p>Jon points out that most bedroom artists don’t spend much time thinking about copyright. “If you’re young enough, you just assume everything’s fair game, especially if you grew up with bands like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Talk_(musician)" target="_blank">GirlTalk</a>. In the underground scene, the blogosphere and stuff like that, if it’s not mainstream, it seems like people don’t really care about copyright.”</p>
<p>“As an artist, I find copyright really obnoxious. I’m really interested in the idea of people sharing their music, so that people m can do whatever they want with it, and what you end up producing is a great mix of a whole bunch of work.”</p>
<p>“There was no question there, I wanted to open the album up for remix.”</p>
<p>Opening up the album, however, required more than just a Creative Commons licence. “You still only have a full song, and you don’t have the individual tracks and parts to sample. One of the most recent songs—<a href="http://jonlemmonmusic.bandcamp.com/track/exodus-i-demo" target="_blank">Exodus</a>—I released of the individual tracks for it as well, just in case anyone wanted to do anything with any of it.”</p>
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1203011011/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" width="400" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>“No one ever commented on it, and I didn’t even know if anyone even saw it or used it at all, but then randomly I was at a show, and some person came up to me and said, ‘hey, I really like your music. It was so awesome that you released all the tracks for that one song. I’ve been playing around with it.’"</p>
<p>Jon, however, is quick to point out that the purpose of Creative Commons is to provide a legal framework for a culture of sharing, remix and reuse that already exists. As Jon puts it, “cultural protection always works better than legal protection.”</p>
<p>Other examples of reuse include Jon and New Zealand duo <a href="http://wetwings.lilchiefrecords.com/">Wet Wings</a> remixing each other’s openly licensed work.</p>
<iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=1256450403/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" width="400" height="100" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>In 2011, Jon found out that “someone had done <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xsn9dvRNLY8">an edit of my song and put it on Youtube</a>, which was cool.”</p>
<p>This turned out to be <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cocobrycebeats">Coco Bryce</a>, an international remix artist. As Jon relates, “He then did another edit, released that, and then got in touch and said, ‘Hey, I’m talking to this record label about releasing this as a single. Would you be interested?’</p>
<p>“I agreed, so he said, ‘we’ll put your original on, my remix on and then we’ll do a version together and put that on, too.’ So that’s what we did.”</p>
<p>The record was released by <a href="http://www.carcrashset.com/releases_ccs2045.php">Car Crash Set in 2011</a>. “That’s the only one of my tracks that’s available from a record label.”</p>
<p>Jon found Creative Commons particularly useful in specifying exactly what kinds of permissions he wanted to allow. “I want to be able to make sure everyone can edit this. But if someone tries to profit from my music, I want to be able set the terms. That was actually really nice—it meant that I was safe, legally.”</p>
<p>I asked Jon whether the culture of remix among bedroom producers included providing attribution. As Jon replied, “you’d be stupid not to. It’s about building relationships. Creative Commons—that concept—is just sensible... It’s the sensible way to do things.”</p>

<p>The Ministry for Culture and Heritage (MCH) is dedicated to supporting New Zealand’s arts, media, heritage and sports organisations, including <a href="http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Creative New Zealand</a>, the <a href="http://www.nzso.co.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="posts/www.radionz.co.nz" target="_blank">RadioNZ </a>and many more.</p>
<p>MCH also produce a range of public resources, including <a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/en" target="_blank">Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand</a> and<a href="http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/" target="_blank"> NZ History Online</a>. Since 2011, the text for both of these sites is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/deed.en" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 New Zealand Licence</a>.</p>
<p>As Matthew Oliver, Manager of the Web Team at MCH, puts it, “We recognised that the taxpayer has paid for this content to be developed, and were aware of plans around NZGOAL, and we saw our content as part of that.”</p>
<p>NZGOAL refers to the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework</a>, which encourages public sector agencies to use Creative Commons licences, to enable the public to share, remix and reuse publicly funded content.</p>
<p>The team was happy to fulfil the principles of NZGOAL, as they had already recognised the importance of disseminating their content. “The more we could get our content used, the more we justify our work. By making our content available for reuse, we show that our content is important, that there is a need.</p>
<p>“The sticking point came down to what sort of licence we’d adopt, which is why we ended up using the non-commercial licence. We had to consider author’s rights, publishing and licensing deals. We were also sensitive to authors, who often work for very little, or for free.”</p>
<p>Matthew believes that Creative Commons licensing could help to reduce some of the duplication that occurs in the cultural sector. “If one organisation is good at storing images, and another is good at writing stories about images, lets combine them, rather than repeating each other’s work.</p>
<p>“It’s great that the cultural sector is starting to share each other’s work, but we should also be sharing it with the public. This ties into the Government’s commitment to supporting innovation. There are some great New Zealand companies who would love some good content. We’ve got content. It’s there. With Creative Commons licensing, they can use it.”</p>
<p>Without Creative Commons licensing, some innovative and important projects may suffer in quality, or never get off the ground. “You just don’t know what people will do with this content, if they could get hold of it. If you make the content available, someone with more time and more expertise is going to do something that a government organisation can’t do.”</p>
<p>Researchers also benefit from open licensing, as it simplifies the process of clearing picture rights. “We also don’t know how much time this is adding to their research, and what they’re deciding not to use.”</p>
<p>Matthew hopes that culture and heritage institutions will continue to open up their collections. “I’m inclined to start from a default position of everything should be open, and let’s see where the problems come up. There’ll always be problems—privacy, donor agreements, <a href="http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/news/media/wai262.asp" target="_blank">WAI262</a>—but the vast majority of content isn’t affected. Start from the other direction.</p>
<p>“If you lock your content away, nobody knows about it. Forget advertising. You don’t need an advertising budget if you let your content go out there and speak for you. If your image goes out there, and it’s got a link back to your website—and if somebody finds that content useful and spreads the word about it—you’re getting free advertising. You’re letting the asset that you’ve got go and promote you as an organisation.”</p>

            </div>
        <div>
<p></p>
<p>In March 2001, <a href="http://www.gns.cri.nz/" target="_blank">GNS Science</a>, in partnership with the <a href="http://www.eqc.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Earthquake Commission</a> (EQC), launched <a href="http://geonet.org.nz/quakes/" target="_blank">GeoNet</a>, a website providing real-time information on a range of geological hazards, including tsunami, volcanic activity and earthquakes. Since 2009, all GeoNet’s data has been made available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>.</p>
<p>The idea for GeoNet came in the mid 1990s, as GNS started a process to get funding to re-establish the old scientific monitoring system. Several years into the process, the Earthquake Commission suggested a partnership.</p>
<p>As Ken Gledhill, who manages the GeoNet project, points out, EQC realised the intrinsic benefits of opening up public earthquake data. In discussions with GNS, EQC insisted that all aspects of the data be made publicly available. “The idea was that the data would be available to all who wanted it, and that wouldn’t just be restricted to New Zealand. It was international. It was intended to increase research and then lead to better knowledge of our geological hazards.”</p>
<p>At this early stage, EQC and GNS agreed on a user licence that was similar in principle to what would become, several years later, Creative Commons. As Ken puts it, “The essence of Creative Commons was already there. The reasons EQC got involved were the same reasons that underpin Creative Commons today: if you hoard it, nothing happens. If you get it out there, there are all sorts of benefits.”</p>
<p>Peter Barker, General Counsel for GNS, agrees: “EQC showed a lot of foresight in going in that direction.”</p>
<p>In 2009, the GeoNet contract between GNS and EQC was renewed, and at that stage it was decided to apply a Creative Commons Attribution licence to the data. “It was a convenient means of doing what we were already doing, and was consistent with government policy.”</p>
<p>"The whole intent of the contract between GNS and EQC for GeoNet was public good. It wasn’t about any particular financial benefit to an organisation.”</p>
<p>Peter points out that the cost of producing data and the need for GNS to operate as a business will continue to complicate the drive to make all scientific data accessible at no cost.</p>
<p>“We don’t believe in hoarding the data, for any reason. We believe in the economic benefit to the country of having the data available and this is how science works. At the same time, in a significant area that we work, the collection of data is quite expensive. We need to see what’s under the earth or sea bed. Drilling, for example, is very expensive, so the financial ramifications have to be considered.</p>
<p>“Also, the <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1992/0047/latest/DLM264292.html" target="_blank">Crown Research Institutes Act</a> requires that we run a viable business and profit is the way we pay for salary increases and scientific equipment. Our model is therefore to make data freely available but sometimes not for free. The cost will reflect our expenses and should not be a barrier to access."</p>
<p>Ken adds that it is much easier for a consortium of organisations to open up for free data produced by high-cost, capital-intensive public good projects like GeoNet, where the costs incurred byGNS are covered. An ongoing example of this kind of collaboration is the effort by GNS and LINZ to measure the gravitational field for science and survey purposes. The raw data they produce from this project will be made available under a Creative Commons Attribution licence.</p>
<p>For other projects, including some involving an inventory of extremophile biological material, GNS have used more restrictive Creative Commons licences. GNS has also licensed <a href="http://www.gns.cri.nz/Home/Products/Databases" target="_blank">a number of the databases </a>on its website under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike licence</a>.</p>
<p>Peter explains that the organisation wanted to use Share-Alike in order to “perpetuate the concept of Creative Commons. A lot of the scientists here are very supportive, as they use open source material in their own research. They believe in it.”</p>
<p>GeoNet remains their most successful example of open data. At its peak, the GeoNet site receives up to 16, 000 visitors a second. There have also been many examples of innovative reuse of GeoNet data. Ken remembers in particular in the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>“A lot of what we saw in those first few months, where people were grabbing the data we were making available, and presenting it in completely new ways. We didn’t like all of it, but that’s tough. Some people did some neat animations, others did 3D imaging. It was really very good.</p>
<p>“There are bright people out there, and if you make it discoverable, they grab onto it really quickly.”</p>

<p>Based in Auckland, New Zealand, <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/" target="_blank">Dylan Horrocks</a> is best known as the author of the award winning <a href="http://vup.victoria.ac.nz/hicksville/" target="_blank"><em>Hicksville</em></a>, a story of a small, comics-obsessed town on New Zealand’s East Coast.</p>
<p><em>Hicksville </em>was named a 'book of the year’ by <em>Comics Journal</em> and features in Auckland University Press’s <a href="http://www.press.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/notices/template/notice_item.jsp?cid=502785" target="_blank"><em>Anthology of New Zealand Literature</em></a>, alongside canonical New Zealand writers James K Baxter, Maurice Gee and Katherine Mansfield.</p>
<p>Dylan is also a long-time supporter of Creative Commons. In fact, since 2009, Dylan has been releasing his work on his website under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial 3.0 New Zealand licence</a>. Users can find finished stories and ongoing serials, including <a href="http://hicksvillecomics.com/magicpen/?p=14" target="_blank"><em>Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen</em></a>.</p>
<p>Dylan first became interested in the the relation between copyright and culture when, as a young comics reader, he saw how many authors had lost the rights to their works—including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman#Publication_history" target="_blank">Siegel and Shuster, the creators of Superman</a>, who sold their work to National Periodicals (later, DC comics).</p>
<p>As Dylan relates, “When freelancers got paid in the early comics industry, they had to sign the back of the cheque to cash it. On the back of the cheque, though, was a printed statement, which basically said ‘all rights to this story and the characters contained therein are hereby handed in perpetuity to the publisher.’</p>
<p>“The key lesson was: never sell your copyright to a company. For a long time, my view of copyright was that it was very, very important for the artist and that you must hold on to it, no matter what.”</p>
<p>Dylan’s view of copyright changed when, in the process of researching a guest lecture for Auckland University, he realised the potential effects of the Internet on the production and distribution of culture.</p>
<p>“I kind of had this revelation: The ease with which media can be copied when it’s digital, and the ease with which it can be distributed through the Internet, offers us an extraordinary historic opportunity.</p>
<p>“Surely we’ve always dreamed of a civilisation in which everyone has access to ideas, without the constraint of shipping piles of paper around the world. As an afterthought, I considered how that would affect the economics of distribution. Having thought about that, I concluded that it might mean the end of royalties. I think it took me two minutes to decide that I was fine with that.”</p>
<p>Dylan realised that the Internet had the potential to expand public access to our rich cultural heritage, including comics. “I’ve spent much of my life hearing rumours of a really interesting comics project, or catching a glimpse of it in some history book about comics, and thinking, I wish I could get my hands on that, and then working so hard looking for ways to access it.”</p>
<p>Dylan talks about Finnish writer and cartoonist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tove_Jansson" target="_blank">Tove Jansson</a>, best known as the inventor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moomin" target="_blank">Moomins</a>. For years, Dylan was unaware that Jannson had drawn a comic strip, until he came across a reference to her in German history of comics. After receiving a photocopy of the comic from historian <a href="http://www.paulgravett.com/" target="_blank">Paul Gravett</a>, Dylan decided to run off thirty more copies and give them away to other cartoonists around the world.</p>
<p>“Eventually, a few years later, my publisher <a href="http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/" target="_blank">Drawn and Quarterly</a> started republishing those comics. They’re selling really well and it’s rewriting the history of comics.”</p>
<p>With the Internet, these practices of sharing and reuse are becoming increasingly common. As Dylan puts it, this is “a fantastic gift to the whole culture. I have access to a vastly greater landscape of recorded culture than any previous generation, and that’s going to change the way artists work. I already see it in the work of younger artists.”</p>
<p>By using a Creative Commons licence on his own work, Dylan hopes that younger artists will be encouraged to remix and adapt their own version of <em>The American Dream</em> or <em>Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen</em>.</p>
<p>As Dylan puts it, “I don’t object to people sharing my work and I don’t object to people using my work as an inspiration for new work, because both for me are really gratifying. It shows that people are engaging with my work and they’re excited by it.</p>
<p>“If people are sharing it around, more people are reading it. The idea that it’s inspiring other people to do new work is gratifying, especially because my work in turn is inspired by other people.”</p>
<p>Creative Commons provides Dylan with an alternative to what he sees as a narrow—but dominant—vision of culture and art. “When I make a piece of art, it’s me responding to a whole lot of art and the world around me. When I finish it, I want it to go back into that flow of art and ideas, and be shared and responded to by people. Treating it as a single piece of property seems wrong. Lots of people have a relationship to that piece of art.”</p>
<p>Dylan decided to apply a Non-Commercial licence, to ensure that commercial publishers wouldn’t distribute his work without his express permission.</p>
<p>“Part of what appeals to me about CC is that the CC licences that I prefer—which tends to be Attribution-Non-Commercial—far more accurately reflect my preference as an author about how my work is used. The idea of some 14 year old getting to read their work and not paying them really doesn’t bug most writers. We don’t want to put walls up around our work. We just don’t want people getting rich off it, without us.</p>
<p>“Creative Commons doesn’t actually take any of the rights I care about as an author. If someone wants to make a big Hollywood film or sell tee-shirts, they can get in touch, just as they can under copyright. And if there is going to be money changing hands, then some of that money should be coming to me.”</p>
<p>Currently, Dylan’s printed comics are not released under a Creative Commons licence. While acknowledging that open licensing could actually <em>increase</em> sales, he notes that many publishers continue to be cautious about copyright. “The fact that I’m serialising stuff online while I’m working on it does cause problems with publishers. It’s an ongoing process. That’s something for the CC community to help with—helping artists who want to use CC to find ways to bring publishers and traditional distributors on board.”</p>
<p>Dylan hopes that his use of Creative Commons licences on his website will encourage young artists to share and adapt his work. “If my comic is photocopied or scanned by a 14 year old and given to his girlfriend—man, I love that. Or if someone wants to make a teeshirt of my comic to give as a present for Christmas, go for it. Creative Commons reflects my own personal ethics about how my work is used.”</p>

<p></p>
<a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/" target="_blank">UC CEISMIC</a> is a federated archive of materials from the Canterbury earthquakes, hosted by the <a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">University of Canterbury</a>, which launched in November 2011. With content provided by major New Zealand cultural institutions, like <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Te Papa</a> and the<a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank"> National Library</a>, as well as ordinary New Zealanders, the archive is an extraordinary—and extraordinarily open—digital resource.
<p>The idea for the archive began when <a href="http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/people/millar.shtml" target="_blank">Associate Professor Paul Millar</a> from the Department of English at the University of Canterbury approached <a href="http://www.hums.canterbury.ac.nz/engl/people/smithies.shtml" target="_blank">Dr James Smithies</a>, then working at the Ministry of Health, about what he could do in response to the February earthquakes.</p>
<p>James pointed Paul to the 9/11 archive, organised by the <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">Center for History and New Media</a> at George Mason University. They also considered the <a href="http://hurricanearchive.org/" target="_blank">Hurricane Memory Bank</a>, a project designed to collect and preserve stories from hurricanes Rita and Katrina. Paul pitched the idea to the university’s Senior Management team and received a very positive response. He immediately began tireless work to get James down to Christchurch and turn the idea into reality.</p>
<p>With these projects in mind, James and Paul considered how they might build something similar for the Canterbury earthquakes. As James put it, the team soon decided that they “would just go out and collect everything.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ceismic.org.nz/programme-team" target="_blank">Dr Christopher Thomson</a>, Programme Office Manager for UC CEISMIC, outlined the steps James and Paul had to take to get the archive online.</p>
<p>“They put a proposal to the university and got some funding to set something up. From there, they started have conversations with people across the cultural heritage sector, and saw that lots of people were asking the same kinds of questions about an archive for the Canterbury earthquakes.</p>
<p>“They then decided to set up the UC CEISMIC consortium.”</p>
<p>The UC CEISMIC consortium is led by the University of Canterbury and made up of organisations from across the cultural heritage sector, including <a href="http://archives.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Archives New Zealand</a>, the <a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/" target="_blank">National Library of New Zealand</a>, the <a href="http://www.mch.govt.nz/" target="_blank">Ministry for Culture</a><a href="http://www.mch.govt.nz/" target="_blank"> and Heritage</a>, the <a href="http://www.canterburymuseum.com/" target="_blank">Canterbury Museum</a>, <a href="http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/" target="_blank">Christchurch City Libraries</a>, <a href="http://www.nzonscreen.com/" target="_blank">NZ OnScreen</a>, the <a href="http://www.ntrc.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">Ngai Tahu Research Centre</a>, <a href="http://cera.govt.nz/" target="_blank">CERA</a>, <a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Te Papa</a> and the <a href="http://www.filmarchive.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Film Archive</a>.</p>
<p>As Christopher puts it, “the idea was that each of the consortium members would collect their own material and archive it according to their own policies, and then use <a href="http://www.digitalnz.org/" target="_blank">DigitalNZ</a> to surface it in one place, so that users could search for earthquake-related content at ceismic.org.nz.”</p>
<p>So where does Creative Commons come in? Given the ambitions of the project, in these early stages “Creative Commons wasn’t in the mix.” Later, though, James began to introduce the idea of open licensing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">James had been a Creative Commons supporter for years, had strong support from Paul to investigate CC licenses, and was offered excellent advice from Jason Darwin at CWA New Media (later <a href="http://www.learningmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Learning Media Limited</a>). He understood the problems ‘All Rights Reserved’ copyright can pose for heritage projects, though, and soon found there were issues having multiple licensing agreements across different sections of the project.</p>

<p>The problem was handed to Christopher Thomson when he arrived in the team. However, little progress could be made, despite his best efforts and those of a range of stakeholders. The problem was worst with research–oriented data, which had specific issues related to ethics and privacy.</p>
<p>In the end, when approaching potential depositors, the UC CEISMIC team recommended the use of Creative Commons licences, though remained open to more restrictive licensing agreements, according to the specific needs of content providers.</p>
<p>The archive launched in November 2011, with ten thousand items, and continues to grow.</p>
<p>The University of Canterbury’s specific contribution to the consortium is called <a href="https://quakestudies.canterbury.ac.nz/" target="_blank">UC QuakeStudies</a>, and includes materials from <a href="http://www.fairfaxmedia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Fairfax Media</a>, <a href="http://www.crc.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank">Environment Canterbury</a> and the <a href="http://www.historic.org.nz/" target="_blank">New Zealand Historic Places Trust</a>. While much of this content remains All Rights Reserved, the archive has recently added a collection by Murray Quartly, who runs <a href="http://www.focus360.co.nz/" target="_blank">focus360.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>After the earthquakes, Murray took a series of 360 degree panorama photographs of central Christchurch, producing what Christopher describes as a “virtual tour of the Red Zone.” After meeting with the UC CEISMIC team, Quartly decided to release the photos under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-No Derivatives licence</a>.</p>
<p>Several more collections are ready to go live, and dozens more planned. Creative Commons will be used as much as possible, and it is hoped that a full review can be undertaken in years to come that assess opportunities to migrate targeted collections to CC licenses.</p>
<p>Another significant part of the consortium is QuakeStories, which is run by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. This archive contains stories and photos from the earthquake from ordinary New Zealanders, and is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share-Alike licence</a>.</p>
<p>Both Christopher and James suggest that the biggest hurdles to using Creative Commons licences have come from researchers—especially those working through the University’s ethics committee, which is already a complex process.</p>
<p>The UC CEISMIC team continue to encourage their partners to use open licensing, wherever possible, and Creative Commons licences remain a core part of the UC CEISMIC programme.</p>
<p>As Christopher points out, “We don’t really know how people are going to use our content. It makes sense to make it open wherever possible, because we don’t know what research questions and methods will be like in 100 years’ time. We want to leave that open as far as possible, for the future.”</p>

<a href="http://www.nzta.govt.nz/" target="_blank">The New Zealand Transport Agency</a> (NZTA) is one of New Zealand’s largest producers of spatial data. Since August 2012, the organisation has been uploading its aerial imagery to <a href="http://koordinates.com/" target="_blank">Koordinates</a>, a platform for geospatial datasets, under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence.</a>
<p>The spatial team has been considering how to open its data since the release of the <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal" target="_blank">New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing (NZGOAL) framework</a>, approved by Cabinet in July 2010. According to Geospatial Specialist Chris Worts, “We realised that this is something we should be doing more. There was nothing stopping us.”</p>
<p>NZTA produces a range of datasets, many of which were available on request. For members of the public, though, this wasn’t necessarily obvious; nor was the process of disseminating the data straight-forward.</p>
<p>When NZTA received a request, someone in the spatial team—often Chris himself—would have to manually extract the data. “It would be a case of emailing data or copying the data onto hard drives and sending it out, which can be labour intensive.”</p>
<p>With hosting platforms like Koordinates—coupled with free open licenses like Creative Commons—it’s become much easier for the public to find and reuse publicly funded datasets. Koordinates provides an ideal platform for NZTA to start releasing their own spatial data, as it is both popular and easy to use.</p>
<p>Before uploading the datasets to Koordinates, Chris had received only handful of enquiries. In the three months since then, the datasets have received <a href="http://koordinates.com/#/maps/nzta/layers/" target="_blank">thousands of views and over 700 downloads</a>—an exponential rise in the reuse of NZTA’s datasets.</p>
<p>Their experience supports <a href="http://www.geospatial.govt.nz/linz-media-release-spatial-information-adds-hundreds-of-millions-to-new-zealand-s-economy/" target="_blank">a 2009 report from Land Information New Zealand</a>. As the report concludes, the financial benefit of opening publicly funded spatial data is enormous:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Had key barriers [to the reuse of publicly funded spatial data] been removed it is estimated that New Zealand could have benefited from an additional $481 million in productivity-related benefits in 2008, generating at least $100 million in government revenue” (ix).</p>

<p>While it's hard to argue with such a conclusion, the process of actually releasing the datasets can be quite complex. Not all datasets produced by NZTA are suitable for public reuse.</p>
<p>Some datasets, for example, might not be accurate in two or three years--or even two or three days--time; also, many are designed for a specific use, and are therefore not suitable for wide release. For this reason, Chris highlights the importance of “providing accurate metadata, so that users know the limitations of a dataset and how, when and why the data was created”.</p>
<p>While the spatial team has no concrete plans to release more datasets, Chris says that the team will continue to release datasets as appropriate in the future.</p>
<p>Other areas of NZTA have also started to embrace Creative Commons licensing. Like many public agencies, NZTA produces an enormous range of content, including advertisements, reports, videos and images. <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/" target="_blank">NZTA's Education Team</a> recently ran a <a href="http://education.nzta.govt.nz/competitions/the-nzta-remix-competition-safer-journeys-for-teens" target="_blank">successful remix competition</a>. The winners included Tawa College’s Drink Driving Website and Darfield High Schools Shakepearean Warrant of Fitness Advertisement.</p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AUav4G_sFdU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Like other government agencies, it looks like NZTA is starting to join the commons. Chris points to a shift in mindset within the organisation.</p>
<p>“It is something different that’s running through your mind now, it’s not just, what can I use it for? Instead we ask, what are the potential wider benefits?”</p>

<p></p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.whs.school.nz/" target="_blank">Wellington High School (WHS)</a> became the first Wellington school to adopt a Creative Commons policy, which mandates a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution licence</a> for all teaching materials.</p>
<p>Under their Creative Commons policy, the teachers of WHS can share, remix and reuse their teaching materials—including quizzes, lesson plans and classroom activities—without having to ask their Board of Trustees for permission.</p>
<p>Before WHS adopted their Creative Commons policy, those teachers that shared their materials online would have been in violation of copyright. This is because, like other New Zealand schools, the copyright to all teaching materials created by WHS teachers in the course of their employment <a href="http://www.tki.org.nz/Copyright-in-Schools/Guidelines-for-schools/For-teachers-and-contractors/Overview-of-copyright-issues#teacher" target="_blank">is held by the WHS Board of Trustees</a>.</p>
<p>As every teacher knows, sharing is a crucial part of education; and <a href="http://www.n4l.co.nz/" target="_blank">with the rollout of Ultra-Fast Broadband</a> and the growing use of portable devices, school leaders are realising that there is an extraordinary capacity to share, adapt and collaborate with others across New Zealand. Without a Creative Commons policy, there is a chance that this potential will remain unrealised.</p>
<p>Changing policies, though, is a big step. How did WHS go about it? The process started on the 23rd of November, 2010, when Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and the OER Foundation hosted <a href="http://wikieducator.org/WeCreate/Events" target="_blank">WeCreate, a Creative Commons workshop for New Zealand educators</a>. With support from the Ministry of Education, the workshop was attended by over 30 Wellington school leaders.</p>
<p>The workshop introduced the suite of Creative Commons licences, outlined <a href="http://ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/information-and-data/nzgoal/" target="_blank">the New Zealand Government’s position on open licensing</a> and encouraged schools to develop policies to allow the development of <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/" target="_blank">Open Education Resources (OERs)</a>. Among the attendees were WHS Classics teacher Trudy Harvey and Librarian Jane Shallcrass.</p>
<p>As Jane put it, “We saw the Albany Senior High School Creative Commons policy and when we came back to school, we decided we should do something about it. We met with one of the Deputy Principals, gave them a copy of the policy and said, ‘we think we should have one of these at our school.’”</p>
<p>As one of the first schools in New Zealand to mandate Creative Commons licensing, school leaders at Wellington High School spent the next year considering the policy. Embracing the Creative Commons ethos, school leaders at Wellington High adapted <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Albany_Senior_High_School/Intellectual_property_policy" target="_blank">the existing Creative Commons policy from Albany Senior High School</a>; this was approved at a board meeting in early 2012.</p>
<p>For Trudy and Jane, this was good news. When the new policy was announced, however, some of the school’s teachers were concerned. Their problem, though, was not Creative Commons--their problem was <em>copyright</em>. Some teachers were worried that the copyright to any work they brought into the classroom—everything from photos to computer programmes—would be automatically owned by the school.</p>
<p>While this is not the case, school leaders were careful to bring more complex cases to the BoT, who made it clear that they had no desire to assert copyright over such works. The school is considering making alterations to the policy to address exceptional cases.</p>
<p>As Jane pointed out, these anxieties about copyright underscore the importance of a Creative Commons policy. <a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/licences/licences-explained/" target="_blank">The easy to understand Creative Commons licences </a>cut through the ambiguities and uncertainties of copyright, ensuring that teachers can legally share and collaborate, without going through the motions of asking permission--or, even worse, breaking the law.</p>
<p>While the Creative Commons policy at WHS is less than a year old, many teachers have started--or continued--to use Creative Commons licences, on everything from general teaching resources to professional development presentations and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WTXeuuotjc" target="_blank">videos of school events</a> (including their recent prize-giving). Jane looks forward to seeing more examples of sharing, remix and reuse in 2013.</p>
