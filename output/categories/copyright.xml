&lt;h4&gt;The copyright regime&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is the recognition of the creator’s interest in benefiting from their work. In the first statutory regime for copyright—the Statute of Anne—its purpose was recorded as the “encouragement of learning...[and of] learned men to compose and write useful books”.[1] Copyright attaches to any original ‘work’.[2] A ‘work’ is any physical manifestation of the application of time, skill and judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, copyright exists in the following types of ‘work’: [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Sound recordings;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Films;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Communication works (sounds, visual images or other information broadcast to the public—e.g. the news); and&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Typographical arrangements of published editions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A work is original if it is not commonplace. It does not need to be unique, but it cannot be substantially similar to any original. Though this standard is often determined on a case-by-case basis, it means that any derivative work can only use the original as inspiration, and cannot express ideas in the same way as the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copyright owner has the exclusive right to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Copy;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Distribute;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Perform;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Play;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Show;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Communicate; or&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Adapt the work&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copyright owner also has the right authorise any person to do any of the aforementioned acts.[4] Anyone who does any one of those acts without the permission of the copyright owner breaches copyright if that act is in relation to a whole or substantial part of the work.[5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Implications for teachers and schools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright raises two main educational issues: first, the use of copyrighted works in the learning process; and second, the use of works created by teachers themselves, but used subsequently by teachers at different schools. The Copyright Act clearly states what actions will breach copyright. [6] However, there are also many exceptions which apply to teachers and students, and it is less clear under what circumstances schools will be able to rely on those exceptions because their language is vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine some of these exceptions. Teachers can make one copy of all or part of a work (excluding film or sound recordings): [7]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) To prepare their lesson; or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) To assist them in delivering the lesson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;c) The copy is for the teacher’s use only&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;d) However, teachers may make multiple non-facsimile copies (e.g. copying out a poem by hand rather than photocopying or scanning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are more restrictive if teachers want to provide copies to students.[8] Teachers can copy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) Up to 3% of the work; or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) Up to 3 pages of the work (whichever is greater); but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;c) The amount copied cannot exceed 50% of the whole work (e.g. if the desired extract is 3 pages, only one and a half pages may be copied)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;d) Teachers may not charge students for the copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the exceptions get even more specific regarding film and sound recordings. For films and soundtracks, teachers can copy that work: [9]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) To prepare their lesson; or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) To assist them in delivering the lesson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;c) The lesson must be to instruct students on how to make such recordings—the recording must be used for its technical aspects, not for its substantive content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;d) Students of such classes may also copy such works, before, during, or after such a class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound recordings may only be copied where the lesson is either a language lesson, or is delivered by correspondence.[10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the rules regarding ‘performance’ works (e.g. dramatic or musical works, and film and TV works) are remarkably relaxed compared with the other rules. Teachers and students may perform literary, dramatic or musical works, or show films or other forms of broadcast works (e.g. radio): [11]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;a) To other students and teachers of the same school (this often excludes parents);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;b) The performance or showing must be for the purposes of instruction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools must store copyrighted material separately from other educational material and must identify the author and source.[12] Access can only be given those who can show (e.g. by logging-on) that they have permission to access to the copy.[13]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Act provides a general ‘fair dealing’ exception limited to use for the purposes of criticism, review, reporting of current events, [14] and for research or private study.[15] This is most applicable to students. Students can copy a reasonable portion of works: ‘Reasonableness’ is often defined in terms of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;i) The purpose use (i.e. the ‘fair dealing’ purposes described above);&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;ii) The nature of the work (i.e. it is less fair to copy a work that required more skill to produce (e.g. a sculpture or painting));&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;iii) The effect copying the work will have on its value;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;iv) The quantity of material copied and the proportion of the final work based on copied material; and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;v) Whether the material could have been bought, and if so, at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, teachers cannot provide students with the copies unless they comply with the 3% or 3 page limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foregoing exceptions apply only to the copying and communication or performance of works. Thus, these exceptions do not allow teachers to adapt the works to suit their own particular needs because there is no ‘fair dealing’ provision which includes adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Solving the issues&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Copyright Act allows owners to license (that is, give permission for) certain actions.[16] However, obtaining licences to use copyrighted materials often involves a significant investment in time and money. If a request for permission is denied, the statutory exceptions, noted above, apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, schools might be more willing than other creators to license the adaptation and use of teaching resources. After all, there is mutual benefit from permitting the use of copyrighted work for education, and little corresponding financial benefit from publishing the resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Creative Commons Licences are one tool that BOTs can use to make resources freely available to others who wish to use them. The licences notify users which actions the copyright holder allows others undertake, and what actions they may not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more creative option would be to encourage more independent research in learning. For example, having students research the material (within guidelines provided by the teacher) would avoid the rule that teachers cannot provide more than 3% or 3 pages of a work to their students. Any use of copyrighted material by students would fall under one or both of the fair dealing exceptions. Of course, this shift in teaching style would not be appropriate for all students or schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reforming copyright&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education exceptions have remained largely untouched by incremental reform—little has been done to address the greater collaboration which the internet has allowed. There is a greater ability for teachers and students spread ideas and to adapt them to suit their own needs—but the copyright regime does not allow this without permission. In effect, derivative works must be created from the ground up because copyrighted works must, in effect, form only the kernel of a derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copyright regime’s purpose does not fit well with education. It is designed to incentivise the production of knowledge by protecting creators’ financial interests. However, if the creators do not benefit, then the underlying purpose of the regime is redundant. It is also arguable that there is a public interest in allowing teachers to adapt works because it allows for the dissemination and for adaptation of educational resources, resulting in better outcomes. Currently, the copyright regime stifles teachers’ creativity (and thus students’ learning) in the name of protecting a non-existent benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their report on the education exceptions under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) concluded that the confusing education exceptions should be replaced by a general ‘fair dealing’ exception.[17] Australia’s education exceptions are very similar to New Zealand’s and were criticised as “inflexible” and “impractical” and inconsistent in their application.[18] The ALRC noted the position in the USA and UK allows “minimal, non-commercial and fair” use, which does not displace the “sale and licensing of education materials”.[19]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ALRC report did not deal with teacher-created content and was rejected by the Australian government. Thus, it seems that concrete reform for adaptive work for teacher-created content is far from becoming a reality any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright is one of the more flexible forms of intellectual property. It can be used to protect almost any form of expression, whether literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, industrial, sound recording, film, communication work, or typographical arrangement.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But from what point does an original copyright work exist? For example, the creation of a single word does not attract copyright protection. That single word does not hold enough creative effort or “originality” to be considered an original literary work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, copying someone else’s existing work, even if showing that work in a new way, is not likely to give rise to an original work.2 A work cannot be original if it is a copy of, or an infringement of, an existing work.3 It must be independently created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, an original work may be created by expending sufficient skill, judgement or labour, even if that work incorporates publicly available information. This may occur, for example, where a person creates a new compilation of available information, such a new recipe or a new directory. In these examples, which require the author’s skill, judgement or labour, the level of creativity or ingenuity required for “originality” may be relatively low.4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if a work is not particularly creative, then how much skill, judgement or labour is required before it becomes an “original” copyright work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Case Study: The Dead Sea Scrolls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Sea Scrolls are ancient religious manuscripts dating back to 200 BC. Part of the Scrolls is the Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah (“MMT”), a particularly sought after Hebrew document that has only been discovered in fragments.5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1954, professors Elisha Qimron and John Strugnell identified, transcribed, and reconstructed countless fragments from six different manuscripts containing the MMT. The professors arranged the manuscript fragments in a way they believed would most accurately represent the original MMT text. That process took 11 years and, even then, more than half the MMT was missing. The professors then filled in, or interpolated, the gaps based on their extensive knowledge and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting ‘Qimron’ version of MMT was finally officially published in 1994. However in 1992 (before the official publication), a member of the Biblical Archaeology Society published a large part of the Qimron MMT, without the professor’s permission. He did this in order to make the MMT available to other scholars, fearing that access to it would otherwise be heavily restricted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qimron sued the Biblical Archaeology Society for copyright infringement, saying that his version of the MMT was unique, and an original copyright work. (Keep in mind that, at the same time, the professors claimed to have formed the most accurate complete version of the original MMT.) So, could the professors claim copyright in the fruits of their labour as “original” literary works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli Supreme Court held that, yes, the work was an original literary work that attracted copyright protection. The professors’ work on the MMT was not purely technical or mechanical labour yielding a predetermined or known result. Instead, the “additional soul” that the professors inspired in the fragments of the Scrolls, with their labour, made them the owners of the copyright in the Qimron MMT text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Factual Enquiry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Qimron case is a particularly fact-specific one, but so are most copyright cases. All of the facts must be considered, including:6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The “starting point” of the work;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The whole of the completed work;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The extent of the copying and alteration (whether a substantial part of the original work survived, so as to appear to be a copy of the original work);&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The quality of the work, rather than the quantity of what has been taken;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Whether mere literal or mechanical copying has taken place;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Whether advantage has been taken of the original work.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After performing this enquiry, one should be left with a reasonable overall impression of whether the new work is in fact an “original” work, regardless of whether it was formed from a spark of creativity, or from the author’s blood, sweat, and tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instagram is a popular mobile application, infamous for its digital filters with alluring names (think Valencia &amp;amp; Amaro), and the use of the hashtag symbol (#). Instagram allows users to upload pictures or videos colloquially known as “grams”, which can then shared with their Instagram followers and on other social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “re-gram” has been coined, describing the process whereby an existing gram is copied from one user and reproduced on another’s profile. The reproduction is typically achieved by either a specifically designed application or simply by taking a screenshot of the original gram on a smartphone. In practice this means that  humorous or memorable grams will go viral, spreading to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Pinterest. The spread of certain grams can be accelerated by the use of the hashtag; a user can search for grams based on a particular theme by looking up a corresponding hashtag. And if they like what they see, they may feel compelled to re-gram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With thousands of grams being uploaded to Instagram every second, the question arises as to who owns them. According to Instagram’s &lt;a title="Instagram terms of use" href="https://help.instagram.com/478745558852511" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt;, users represent and warrant that they own the content posted, or that they have the right to post such content. They further represent and warrant that the content posted does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of third parties, which include but are not limited to privacy, copyright, trade mark, and other intellectual property rights. As a side note, while Instagram does not claim ownership over content, the Terms of Use state that users grant Instagram a non-exclusive and worldwide licence to use their content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js" async="" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems regarding copyright ownership is that users, including businesses and celebrities, will often re-gram photos without any consideration for the copyright implications. This is certainly not a socially responsible practice, and it is this blissful ignorance that has led to parties being &lt;a title="Guardian article about Instagram" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2013/feb/05/instagram-users-fightback-stolen-photos" target="_blank"&gt;caught out&lt;/a&gt; for using other people’s grams. Further, it is also common for media to be re-grammed multiple times to the point where the original source can not be located, and even then, crediting a source in itself is not a defence to copyright infringement. Interestingly, in the United Kingdom, the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 provides a solution to this. It allows a person to use a copyrighted work for free without the consent of the owner if, after a “diligent search” in accordance with the prescribed regulations, the owner cannot be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution to the danger of the re-gram -- and one that all users can benefit from -- is Creative Commons licensing. There are a variety of licences available to users; all require attribution and some are for non-commercial use only.  Users can manually add a CC licence in their Instagram profile description or in the caption of a gram. They can also follow this up by hashtagging “creative commons”, thereby enabling other users to search for openly licensed media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instagram does not currently facilitate a platform for users to license their grams with ease, but there are other ways of doing this. For example, Instagram allows users to directly share photos to their Flickr accounts and, in turn, Flickr allows its users to choose a particular CC licence under which they can share their photos. Flickr also enables users to search for photos that have been published online under the different CC licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is  &lt;a title="I Am CC" href="http://i-am-cc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;i-am-cc.org&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party archive that allows users to CC-license photos for three months from the date they sign up to the archive. i-am-cc.org’s &lt;a title="I Am CC Manifesto" href="http://i-am-cc.org/manifesto/" target="_blank"&gt;manifesto &lt;/a&gt;explains that the three-month period is imposed as people may forget what they signed up for, and i-am-cc endeavours to be a “legitimate repository of free images”. There are also a variety of websites supplying CC-licensed images for the public that instagrammers may re-use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the re-gram is something that Instagram users should adopt with caution. The use of CC licensing is an excellent mechanism to lawfully perpetuate media, and, the more users who opt in, the more media they have to benefit from. It is yet to be seen whether Instagram will allow users to opt into CC licensing their grams. This may be a smart move, and the issue may become more prominent as more parties are caught out for irresponsible re-grams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some organisations, like Public Service Departments, are directed to use NZGOAL; state services agencies are strongly encouraged, while school Boards of Trustees are invited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years on, we’ve seen a reasonably steady uptake on NZGOAL. Public Service Departments are getting steadily better at using open licensing by default, especially data-heavy agencies like Statistics New Zealand, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry for the Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also seeing uptake in the GLAM sector, with Te Papa, National Library of New Zealand and Auckland Museum all making commitments to open licensing. Schools are also beginning to use CC - we’ve currently got around ninety schools with CC policies, and more to come in the future. Local government and research institutions are also beginning to make moves towards greater openness, which is great to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NZGOAL gradually became the default setting for the release of an increasing number copyright and non-copyright works, New Zealand Open Government Data Programme decided that the policy and guidance materials it uses needed updating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important change was the simplification of the review and release process flow-chart. You can read about the other changes &lt;a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal2/#changelog" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, though -- from our point of view at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, at least -- is that Creative Commons HQ finished its exhaustive process of developing &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/version4" target="_blank"&gt;the 4.0 version of the CC licences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original version of NZGOAL recommended the use of the Creative Commons 3.0 New Zealand licences. These licences had been ‘ported’ for New Zealand law. If you’re interested in learning more about this, &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/whats-licence/" target="_blank"&gt;check out this interview we conducted with Andrew Matangi&lt;/a&gt;, who led the initial porting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is nothing wrong with the 3.0 NZ licences, the arrival of the 4.0 licences is a welcome opportunity to ensure that everyone in the world is using the same CC licences. The CC licence chooser -- which many people use to get their standard licensing statement -- also puts some hurdles in the way of those people looking for the earlier, ported licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that the NZGOAL team have decided to officially recommend the 4.0 licences. While agencies can still decide to use the older 3.0 NZ licences if they want, the guidance material provided by NZGOAL will recommend the 4.0 licences. Over time, we can expect more and more agencies to go down the CC 4.0 road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you with works licensed under CC 3.0 NZ -- or any other licence -- you don’t need to worry. This licence is still legally valid and robust, and can still be used to licence your work. And if you want to change, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/nzgoal.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2015 11:08:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weeks 2 and 3 of the CC Road Trip</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/weeks-2-and-3-of-the-creative-commons-road-trip.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY ELIZABETH HERITAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, we turned around twice and suddenly it’s the fourth week of the Creative Commons Road Trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Matt McGregor and I were in the same room as each other for the first time in a couple of weeks, and we took the opportunity to swap notes. It’s been a crazy busy fortnight but so much fun. Huge thanks to our awesome team of speakers and facilitators who are doing such a brilliant job -- and thank you to everyone who has come along so far. We’re really enjoying meeting new people, fielding new questions (that always make us think!), and hearing new stories about how Kiwis are using -- or want to use -- Creative Commons in such a range of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 2 of the Road Trip saw us travelling around the country; Matt in the North Island and me in the South. Between us -- and with the help of our trusty facilitators -- we delivered events in Hamilton, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Whanganui. Then Week 3 was even busier: the Creative Commons Road Trip made back to Auckland, Hamilton, and Dunedin, plus branching out to Tauranga and Palmerston North. Events have been targeted at the schools and heritage sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been great to have requests come in from schools and heritage institutions around the country for events where they are. We’ve added Napier to the mix now! The CC Road Trip will be there on 1-2 April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that weren’t enough, we’re really pleased to announce that we’re extending the Road Trip and branching out into Open Education. Come along to hear about the future of Open Educational Resources in Aotearoa, featuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Billy Meinke, formerly of Creative Commons International, who will talk about his experience with some of the world’s largest OER projects, including the US Government’s $2billion TAAACT grants for OERs at community colleges.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Simon Hart, Richard White and Erika Pearson from the Media Text Hack team at the University of Otago, who will talk about the development of an open, CC-licensed Media Studies textbook — over the course of a weekend.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Matt McGregor, Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, who will talk about the future of OERs in the Kiwi tertiary sector, and talk about how educators and institutions can create, use and adopt open textbooks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be running events in mid-April in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, completely free. &lt;a title="OER events" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2015/03/open-education-in-aotearoa/" target="_blank"&gt;Register here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards to Week 4! There are still places left for our Wellington and Christchurch heritage sector events, so &lt;a title="GLAM Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-489" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-GLAM-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have officially completed the first five events of the Creative Commons Road Trip! When we planned the events back in December last year, we were expecting a quiet start to the month, with some &lt;a title="CC Road Trip schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;schools events&lt;/a&gt; in Auckland and Wellington, gradually branching out to Hamilton, Christchurch and Dunedin in the second week. In the third and fourth week, we were planning to basically repeat that pattern, shifting focus to the &lt;a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;heritage sector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we promoted the month, though, we started to get requests from other parts of the country,  quickly turning a tour of the main centres into a truly national road trip. Now that the organisational dust has settled, we’ve decided to also visit Tauranga, Napier, Havelock North, Whanganui, Palmerston North, Nelson and Greymouth. We’re also making plans to visit Hutt City, Whangarei and Invercargill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-488" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RoadTripPoster_cc-by-school-213x300.jpg" alt="CC BY" width="213" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CC BY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we had a busy first week! In addition to the Creative Commons schools events in Wellington and Auckland, we held events in Greymouth, Nelson and Havelock North. Attendance varied: we had a small turnout for an after-school event in Auckland, though the staffroom at Havelock North High School at 8am was full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights from week one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;The Network for Learning officially joined the Creative Commons Road Trip, with Tim Kong, Pete Hall and Carolyn Stuart attending the school events.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We had some &lt;a title="Bay of Plenty Times" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/bay-of-plenty-times/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503343&amp;amp;objectid=11412205" target="_blank"&gt;handy coverage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Bay of Plenty Times&lt;/i&gt;, advertising our events in Tauranga on 16 March.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Melissa Laing, one of the new CC regional facilitators, gave her first (of many, we hope!) introductions to CC licensing, alongside Pete Hall from N4L and Esther Casey from Cognition Education.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;As one of our speakers was ill, Matt skyped into an event at Nelson Provincial Museum -- from a half-full internet cafe in Napier. Both the Nelson museum community and the Napier internet-cafe community now have a working knowledge of CC licensing in the heritage sector.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We’re receiving a heap of requests to send out resources. Keep them coming!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We’ve launched our &lt;a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;new resources page&lt;/a&gt;, full to the brim with brochures, videos, posters and case studies on CC licensing in tertiary education, research, heritage and schools.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In week two -- starting today! -- we’re going to be running schools events in Wellington, Christchurch, Hamilton and Dunedin, as well as a heritage event in Whanganui. Week two happens to overlap with international &lt;a title="Open Education Week" href="http://www.openeducationweek.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Week&lt;/a&gt;, so we’re excited to join our friends and colleagues around the world in spreading the news on the benefits of open educational resources. There are still places available at all our upcoming events, so &lt;a title="CC Road Trip" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/12/announcing-our-march-events/" target="_blank"&gt;register today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going on a road trip -- please join us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my &lt;a title="CCANZ" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ&lt;/a&gt; (CCANZ) colleague Matt McGregor &lt;a title="On Recent Changes at CC Aotearoa" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/recent-changes-cc-aotearoa/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote an article&lt;/a&gt; setting out our goals here at CCANZ, and the thinking behind them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In general, these &lt;a title="CCANZ goals" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/roadmap-2014-2016/" target="_blank"&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; centre on CCANZ assisting a range of public-sector organisations with open policy adoption and implementation, with a particular focus on the heritage, research and schools sectors. Our workplan focuses on providing a heap of in-person workshops and resources, including targeted policy toolkits, brochures, posters and discussion pieces from the CC community. … While we still support licence adoption in the creative sector, and still support sensible copyright reform, open policy advocacy has become the clearest path for a small NGO like CCANZ to contribute to lasting social change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s time for us to hit the road and really help that change take off. Firstly, we’re developing a whole new set of resources to enable Kiwis to understand how copyright works in Aotearoa and how Creative Commons can help people solve copyright-related problems in the workplace. No law degree required! We have created special, sector-specific toolkits for use in NZ schools, universities, polytechs, museums, archives, libraries and other educational or heritage institutions. These are all freely available at &lt;a title="CC resources" href="http://resources.creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;resources.creativecommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt; and include policy templates, case studies, posters, educational videos, slides and articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Off-the-shelf policy templates that have been tried and tested in Kiwi institutions -- just change the names!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Fully up to date and compliant with NZ law&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Created in consultation with people whose day job is copyright licensing, and designed to help solve real-life, specific problems&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Detailed case studies showing how Kiwis around the country are using Creative Commons to help solve copyright problems&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Simple and easy to use -- no copyright expertise required!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Written by a combination of experts with detailed working knowledge of copyright law, Creative Commons licensing, and how these issues specifically pertain to the educational and heritage sectors in Aotearoa.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Red_Logo.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-450 size-full" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Red_Logo.jpg" alt="Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand" width="240" height="240"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand. Logo licensed CC BY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, as well as making these resources freely downloadable to everyone who comes to our website, we are also taking them to schools and heritage institutions around the country -- in fact, we’re going on a road trip! We've made a &lt;a title="CC Road Trip schools poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-school-a3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;poster for schools&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a title="CC Road Trip GLAM poster" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cc-by-GLAM-a3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;poster for GLAM&lt;/a&gt; that we invite you to display and share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve gathered together a bunch of wonderful speakers from within the Creative Commons community who between them have decades of experience in negotiating the realities of copyright and licensing specifically in NZ schools and heritage institutions, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Andrew Matangi, Consultant, Buddle Findlay, Creative Commons Aotearoa NZ Legal Team&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Victoria Leachman, Rights Advisor, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Stephen Lethbridge, Principal, Taupaki School&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Matt McGregor, Public Lead, Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (and me)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Mark Osborne, Senior Consultant, Core Education&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Keitha Booth, Manager, NZ Open Government Data Programme&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Anton Angelo, Research Data Co-ordinator, University of Canterbury Te Whare Wānanga o Waitara&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Richard White, University Copyright Officer, University of Otago Te Whare Wānanga o Otāgo&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Amanda Curnow, Web Technologies Librarian, Massey University Library Te Putanga Ki Te Ao Mātauranga&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, Digital NZ; Member, Open Knowledge Foundation, Open GLAM Working Group&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader, Alexander Turnbull Library&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Esther Casey, Facilitator, Cognition Education&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Stephen McConnachie, ELearning Coordinator, Middleton Grange School&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re running more than a dozen (and counting!) events all across the country in March 2015. Details and registration at &lt;a title="CC Road Trip GLAM" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;creativecommons.org.nz/glamroadtrip&lt;/a&gt; for the GLAM sector and &lt;a title="CC Road Trip Schools" href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip/" target="_blank"&gt;creativecommons.org.nz/schoolsroadtrip&lt;/a&gt; for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are really keen to reach as many people as possible, so if you want to host an event at your place, please let us know: &lt;a href="mailto:matt@creativecommons.org.nz"&gt;matt@creativecommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, we at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand have been thinking about an obvious but difficult question: what does a successful Creative Commons affiliate look like? This question has two interrelated parts. First, how should we structure ourselves? Second, what are our priorities? What are our goals? What should we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sometimes seems like every CC affiliate has taken a different answer to that first question, which is hardly a surprise, given the diversity of the global affiliate community. Some affiliates are part of larger NGOs or thinktanks; some are located in faculties of law; others are more or less independent entities. Some larger countries, like Canada and India, have multiple affiliates, which share a range of legal and advocacy projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has always been part of a larger NGO, though over the last year we've been slowly moving towards greater independence. In July, we left our long term host, the Royal Society of New Zealand, who had provided everything from office space to accounting, governance and managerial support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In moving to our new host, the wonderful Open Education Resources Foundation, our advisory board and staff took on more responsibility, in return for greater control over our budget and leaner decision making processes. Simply put, we chose this new structure because it enabled us to do much more with our limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the second question: as part of this move to greater independence, we also started rethinking what we do, day-to-day. The first thing we did, in late 2013, was move away from the breakdown of projects we'd borrowed from CCHQ. We decided that the four headings – 'Culture', 'Science', 'Government', and 'Education' – were too vague and broad to adequately represent our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Culture,' for example, encompasses GLAM, creative arts and indigenous knowledge, which are three distinct projects. The same was true of education, which encompassed both our schools OER project and our OER project in the tertiary education sector -- which actually have relatively little to do with each other. Finally, the former literature teacher in me bristled that 'Science' was being used as a shorthand for 'open access to scholarly publishing.' As a result, we ditched 'Science' for 'Open Access to Research', and created a new project area for 'Open Data.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the process, we had created eight new project areas – replacing the original four – which you can see &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;on the front page of our website&lt;/a&gt;. For each of these projects, we developed an introduction and brought together a growing range of resources. We also developed a series of overarching goals (which we shared in our roadmap), and we are currently developing &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jglu6rp8aH7y35BEMyzbgKt5tA7psDqAbgOrS93kjOM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;a detailed workplan&lt;/a&gt;, which will outline how these goals will be achieved&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, these goals centre on CCANZ assisting a range of public-sector organisations with open policy adoption and implementation, with a particular focus on the heritage, research and schools sectors. Our workplan focuses on providing a heap of in-person workshops and resources, including targeted policy toolkits, brochures, posters and discussion pieces from the CC community – which we have started to publish on our new sister site, NZCommons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this focus on open policy, we seem to be moving in the same direction as many other CC affiliates and NGOs (as the establishment of the &lt;a href="http://openpolicynetwork.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Policy Network&lt;/a&gt; suggests). While we still support licence adoption in the creative sector, and still support sensible copyright reform, open policy advocacy has become the clearest path for a small NGO like CCANZ to contribute to lasting social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our success will largely depend on the growing number of volunteers and champions in and around our public institutions willing to advocate for open licensing to their colleagues, managers, clients and boards. A key part of our job – and one of the reasons we provide workshops and produce resources – will be to support the work these champions are doing to grow the commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/recent-changes-cc-aotearoa.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:22:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Busy Year for the Commons in Aotearoa</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/busy-year-commons-aotearoa.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is re-posted from &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog" target="_blank"&gt;the Creative Commons International blog&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks for Asia Pacific Regional Coordinator Jessica Coates for the editorial assistance!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the first of a series of blog posts focusing on our global activities, Matt McGregor tells us of exciting developments in CC in New Zealand Aotearoa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 has been a busy year for the commons in Aotearoa. After a few years of relatively slow progress, many of New Zealand’s public institutions have started to adopt open policies. So many, in fact, that we’ve decided to launch an entire website, &lt;a href="http://http://nzcommons.org.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;NZCommons.org.nz&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to discussing the opportunities and challenges of opening New Zealand’s culture and knowledge for access and reuse. With a particular focus on copyright, licensing and the public domain, the NZCommons site aims to help cross-pollinate and energise the various open groups in New Zealand, who are all doing excellent work, though too often in isolation from one another. The site will have news, case studies and a range of pieces from New Zealanders working to grow the commons, supporting and encouraging the many individuals and institutions working to adopt CC licensing across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what a lot there is to be discussed. I’ve already mentioned some of the developments being highlighted on NZCommons in my &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/43758"&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; to this blog about Creative Commons policies being passed in New Zealand schools, now up to the rate of around one per week. But the increased adoption of CC licensing hasn’t been limited to schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, both the &lt;a href="http://www.waikato.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;University of Waikato&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.canterbury.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;University of Canterbury&lt;/a&gt; passed open access mandates requiring all research published within their respective institutions to be uploaded to the library’s repository, enabling research to be made openly available as soon as possible. In so doing, they joined &lt;a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Lincoln University&lt;/a&gt; in paving the way for open access policies at other New Zealand research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, in the middle of the year, we saw three big developments in the heritage sector. First, the &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz" target="_blank"&gt;National Library of New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; passed their excellent &lt;a href="http://natlib.govt.nz/blog/posts/our-new-use-and-reuse-policy"&gt;use and reuse policy&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a clear framework for opening up the library’s collections. Under the policy, out-of-copyright works will be clearly labelled as such, which has not generally been the case in the sector; also, in-copyright works that are owned by the library will be made available under a Creative Commons licence. Our &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/national-librarys-new-use-reuse-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;case study of this policy has been up on NZCommons for a few weeks now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Te Papa&lt;/a&gt;, the Museum of New Zealand followed this announcement by &lt;a href="http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2014/06/03/free-downloadable-images-from-te-papas-collections/" target="_blank"&gt;releasing over 30,000 high resolution images&lt;/a&gt; under either a no-known copyright or a &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives licence&lt;/a&gt; — a figure that has since approached 40,000. As it happens, we published a &lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/te-papas-openly-licensed-images/" target="_blank"&gt;case study about Te Papa&lt;/a&gt; recently, as well. Since that release, Te Papa have signalled that they will shortly remove the ‘ND’ restriction from their licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/" target="_blank"&gt;WW100&lt;/a&gt; team, announced that as part of New Zealand’s commemorations of the Centenary of World War I, the &lt;a href="https://natlib.govt.nz/collections/a-z/alexander-turnbull-library-collections" target="_blank"&gt;Turnbull Library&lt;/a&gt; was openly releasing the H Series of photographs taken during by New Zealand’s official photographer, Henry Armytage Sanders. As Melanie Lovell-Smith points out in a &lt;a href="http://ww100.govt.nz/photographing-new-zealanders-at-war" target="_blank"&gt;detailed background piece&lt;/a&gt;, these photographs are “the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on the Western front from 1917 to 1918.” Other GLAM projects, such as the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/11/marsden-online-archive/" target="_blank"&gt;Marsden Online project&lt;/a&gt;, are also starting to use CC licensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting things about these announcements is the best practice implementation by each of the institutions. Although all of them use their own method, all of the photos are clearly marked as being available to download and free of copyright restrictions, with a detailed and easily accessible description of what you can and can’t do with the image (see pictured). Te Papa even allows you to use copyright status as a search term. This level of transparency when it comes to copyright is essential to unlocking the value of our national collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/Object/41504/download"&gt;Excerpt from Te Papa’s image download page&lt;/a&gt; / Te Papa Tongarewa&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other open projects — such open government data, open textbooks in higher education and legal tools for indigenous knowledge — are also progressing quickly. Working with Susy Frankel and Aroha Mead from &lt;a href="http://www.victoria.ac.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Victoria University of Wellington&lt;/a&gt; and CC Panel Member Karaitiana Taiuru, the local Creative Commons team is working on developing an indigenous knowledge notice that will help Māori creators, iwi (tribe) and hapū (sub-tribe) to release their works more openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the government data sector, &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Land Information New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; have released truly massive — and massively interesting — open datasets, including detailed aerial photography of the entire country and &lt;a href="http://www.linz.govt.nz/news/2014-03/3d-models-released-christchurch-city" target="_blank"&gt;3D models of Christchurch before September 2010&lt;/a&gt;. These openly licensed models can be adapted and 3D printed by anyone, to help remember the heritage that was lost in the earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these projects will add an enormous amount of high quality copyright works to the commons, making it easier to access and reuse the works produced and held by New Zealand’s public institutions. These releases promise to save time and money for both the organisations involved and the public. They will also enable others to adapt and build on existing works, which means that fewer people will have to — excuse the cliche — reinvent the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, then. But these projects are only the beginning: there are thousands of other schools, heritage and research institutions with millions of copyright works that could be made openly available to the public for sharing and reuse. This could fundamentally change how New Zealanders access and engage with their culture and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to happen, these sectors are going to need some help. To help out, we’re developing toolkits — remixing some resources and platforms developed by HQ, and making a bunch of our own — that organisations can use to open their works for reuse. These toolkits will include an introductory paper, brochures, articles, sample policies and examples of best practice from New Zealand and around the world. We’re hoping to launch them at the National Digital Forum in Wellington in late November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the toolkits, though, we’re going to need much more open discussion and analysis on copyright, licensing and reuse — especially in the heritage sector, where copyright issues can be very complicated, and where there isn’t nearly enough information and discussion available online. NZCommons is designed to prompt that discussion. With it we hope to build momentum and support for more open policy across the country, and help realise the potential of the commons in Aotearoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Copyright</category><category>Data</category><category>Education</category><category>Heritage</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><category>Research</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/busy-year-commons-aotearoa.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2014 08:58:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why Politicians Should Use CC Licences</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/politicians-use-cc-licences.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY HARRY CHAPMAN&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which I’ve noticed recently is that New Zealand politicians are terrible at using &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/about"&gt;Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; to allow use of their photos. That’s a real shame, and in this post I’ll explore why it’s in politicians’ best interest to upload good quality photos of themselves and their activities using a permissive Creative Commons (CC) licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians spend a whole heap of time engaged in self-promotion — after all, they need to be elected to their job. Hence a big part of a politician’s job is attending events, meeting with members of the public and industry groups, pressure groups etc. At the intersection of this relentless campaigning and the rise of social media is that if you look at politicians’ Twitter or Facebook profiles, they’re always posting pictures of that campaigning online. They want the most people possible to see that they’re working hard, talking to “hard-working New Zealanders”, “Mum and Dad investors”, and “people who just want to get ahead”. They want the maximum number of people looking at evidence of all the good work they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So politicians post an inordinate number of photos and videos on social media, or perhaps Flickr. They also put out nice photos of themselves for use in the media free of charge. But the problem is that the copyright status of all these images is unclear, and most non-media people would be wary of using those photos for most purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few extra clicks, all the content politicians are putting up to promote themselves and their causes could be made much more useful, both to the politician themselves, as well as to society. The easiest way to do that is to simply release all your photos and videos under a permissive Creative Commons licence (CC-BY or CC-BY-SA). That way, the potential of the content is unlocked. For example, someone editing a politician’s Wikipedia page doesn’t have to go out and take a (probably) crappy photo of them, rather they can use a high-quality, flattering photo of the politician and make them look good. Likewise a person putting together a booklet about different politicians’ policies can use a nice photo with a clear conscience. Or someone preserving political campaigns and associated material for posterity can archive content without running into legal barriers. Put simply, put your content on the internet with a CC licence and people will use it to do cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/john-key-vs-david-cunliffe-e1416298738727.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-418" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/john-key-vs-david-cunliffe-e1416298738727.jpg" alt="The difference a good photo makes on Wikipedia. Cunliffe’s staff could have uploaded a better photo – instead we have him looking sideways (text CC-BY-SA, photos PD)" width="500" height="443"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The difference a good photo makes on Wikipedia. Cunliffe’s staff could have uploaded a better photo – instead we have him looking sideways (text CC-BY-SA, photos PD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t think of any reasons why politicians shouldn’t embrace Creative Commons licences: they can only win if they put nice photos of themselves onto the internet for people to view, use, and redistribute. (Perhaps politicians and their staff are worried what will happen if they post CC-licenced photos or video and then someone comes along and makes a parody of them. But in all likelihood the parody artist would have just used copyrighted material if the freely-licenced stuff wasn’t available, and the presence of your photos might just encourage this potential parody artist to use a more flattering picture of the politician!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of all the positives, and the lack of downsides, it seems somewhat puzzling to me why more politicians haven’t embraced Creative Commons. I think the main reason probably comes down to a lack of awareness about Creative Commons licences and their potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screenshot-181114-212827.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-419" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screenshot-181114-212827.png" alt="Without freely licenced photos, you’re invisible on Wikipedia (text CC-BY-SA, Andrew pic PD, Grant and David pics by Charles Chauvel CC-BY)" width="429" height="591"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Without freely licenced photos, you’re invisible on Wikipedia (text CC-BY-SA, Andrew pic PD, Grant and David pics by &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/charleschauvel/" target="_blank"&gt;Charles Chauvel &lt;/a&gt;CC-BY)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d do a little digging to see what licence the various parties and politicians are using on their Flickr accounts. Flickr has creative commons licences built right in, so it’s a good way of putting photos on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nzlp/"&gt;Labour Party&lt;/a&gt;: don’t seem to use their account, and all the photos are all rights reserved.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/charleschauvel/"&gt;Charles Chauvel&lt;/a&gt;: one of the only (ex) politicians I’ve seen using a permissive CC-BY licence for his photos. Even though he’s left politics in NZ, his photos are still used for stuff (e.g. pictures of Grant Robertson and David Parker on Wikipedia above).&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/nznationalparty/"&gt;National Party&lt;/a&gt;: active account, licence their photos under the restrictive CC-BY-NC-ND (can use unchanged photos in non-commercial ways with attribution)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Green Party: don’t have an account&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;New Zealand First: don’t have an account&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
