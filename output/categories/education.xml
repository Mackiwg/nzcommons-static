&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This post introduces some ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints. If you want to get involved, you can:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;* &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank"&gt;join our organising group (on a platform called Loomio)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;* &lt;a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/sprints" target="_blank"&gt;fill out the expression of interest form&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Let's Sprint!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise &lt;a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.nz/sprints" target="_blank"&gt;the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my post last week, we’re getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s our opinion at CCANZ that it’s about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers can work together to make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;What's a Sprint, Anyway?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with the first one. What’s a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a ‘hack.’ &lt;a href="https://www.govhack.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;The ‘GovHack’ weekends&lt;/a&gt; are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/2014/02/announcing-the-creative-commons-media-studies-textbook/" target="_blank"&gt;Media Text Hack&lt;/a&gt; (there’s that word again), where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It’s now an assigned undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/oppikirjamaraton"&gt;Oppikirjamaraton&lt;/a&gt; (that’s Finnish for ‘textbook marathon). This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work. Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology - surprise, surprise) and what they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Decisions, Decisions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these fantastic examples, there’s still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We’ve decided to open up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools, associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about? I’ll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/g/23k8VZ9w/oer-sprints" target="_blank"&gt;and in our open Loomio group&lt;/a&gt;, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;How long should it last for? Some sprints last for two days, others just one. Some sprints keep strict, family-friendly time-frames, while others keep working deep into the night. My feeling is that we ought to keep it short and sweet - i.e a busy 9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though with an expectation than many participants won’t be able to commit for the full period.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Technology - the bane of many such events. We’ll need to find a technical platform that works for everyone. My initial thinking is that Google Docs will work fine for small teams, and is a technology many teachers already use. Some bigger projects with many more collaborators  have had issues with using Google Docs, and more technical platforms - like Github - have also been problematic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators. What skills do we need? And what’s the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as ‘by teachers, for teachers’, with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take advantage of the collective expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;What’s a ‘resource’? Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling is that a ‘resource’ is whatever the heck participants decide to make on the day, and that this should be the decision of each individual team.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Team formation: what constitutes a team? How many people? 3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure about this.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;What about virtual participation? If we’re working on Google docs, this is fine - though virtual collaboration can breed those dreaded Technological Problems, which we’ll want to avoid. But we shouldn’t put any barriers on people participating, either.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;What will the events actually look like? My assumption is that it will involve people sitting at tables, talking and typing. We should try to minimise the amount of scene-setting at the beginning, and look to have a plethora of helpers to solve problems as they arise. This will involve giving clear guidance beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about at the beginning is probably unavoidable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;How much does it cost? From our point of view, there are two sorts of costs: event costs; and outreach costs, before and after the event. For the event, we’ll need funding or in-kind sponsorship to cover food, drink, venue, technology and other incidental costs. For the outreach, we’ll need funding to get resources on CC and OER to as many teachers as possible.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Finally, how many events? We’re not sure, yet, though before the end of the year, we should make some initial committments. I’m obviously keen to have them anywhere and everywhere, though this will depend on us getting strong local support.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

Creative Commons policies in kiwi schools</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/do-i-really-have-to-think-about-copyright.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;CC Policies for All!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a few years now, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/about/who-we-are/"&gt;we at CCANZ&lt;/a&gt; - that’s Elizabeth and me and a broad community of volunteers - have been working on a sprawlingly ambitious project that has since become known as ‘CC in Schools.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the main part of &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org.nz/ccinschools/" target="_blank"&gt;CC in Schools&lt;/a&gt; has been advocating for individual schools to pass Creative Commons policies. These policies, approved at a Board of Trustees level, simply give permission for teachers to share their resources using a CC licence. We’ve written about this a tonne--including in just about every teaching publication in the country--so I won’t go into it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re pretty happy with the progress. We’ve got around 100 schools on board - and probably quite a few more that haven’t got in touch with us - including some of the largest schools in the country, such as Hutt Valley High School, Burnside High School and Middleton Grange. We’re going to continue to beaver away, and are working at partnering more formally with some of the bigger educational fish in Aotearoa, to help scale this work to every other school in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;So We Have This CC Policy...&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the point of these CC policies was never just to have some nice-sounding pieces of paper in various school policy packs. CC in Schools was (and is) motivated by a desire to: a) make it less risky for teachers to share their work; and b) grow a commons of open educational resources. This will save time and money and ensure that the best resources in the country are available to anyone who wants them, free of technical, price and legal restrictions on reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In advocating for these policies, we’ve faced one basic hurdle - and, by the way, this hurdle is categorically not that schools and teachers don’t want to share their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a hurdle that’s best summed up by a lovely cartoon that Jessica Coates, from our mates at CC Australia, likes to use in her presentations. It’s something that all of us (except, perhaps, for IP lawyers) can sympathise with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copyright-Law.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-753 size-full" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Copyright-Law.jpg" alt="Copyright Law" width="532" height="407"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Slide 12 from "&lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Jessicacoates/open-access-glam-34793864"&gt;Open Access GLAM&lt;/a&gt;" by Jessica Coates. Made available under a &lt;a href="http://Slide%2012%20from%20%22Open%20Access%20GLAM%22%20by%20Jessica%20Coates.%20Made%20available%20under%20a%20CC%20BY%203.0%20unported%20licence."&gt;CC BY 3.0 unported licence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Do I Really Have To Think About Copyright?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the hurdle: most people just don’t want to spend their time thinking about copyright. Those who dip their toes into the copyright waters tend to find out pretty quickly that copyright isn’t intuitive; it isn’t common sense: and it doesn’t work in the way that many people would like. They also find that some parts of copyright -- like permitted uses for educators -- can get quite complex, and they generally have a hard time getting straight answers (sometimes because those straight answers simply don’t exist).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright discussions also have a habit of becoming overly moralistic (‘stealing’, ‘ripping off’), technical (‘see section 21.2 of the 1994 Copyright Act’) or otherwise devolving into a lecture (‘In 1709, the Statute of Anne...’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this is unavoidable. Copyright isn’t going away, and unless New Zealand decides to adopt more liberal and broad fair use exceptions in our upcoming review, some of the complexity isn’t going to go away, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Spend Less Time Thinking about Copyright&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of it really is avoidable. A big part of the problem with copyright and educational resources in New Zealand is that creators effectively outsource thinking about copyright to the end user. Even when works are made to be freely shared and adapted - like many educational resources - the user has the burden of figuring out whether their use is legal. They may choose not to use the work at all; they may use it, and risk breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we need more creators to use CC. It brings me back to one of the goals of CC in Schools (worth keeping in mind with policies like this): to grow a commons of educational resources where &lt;em&gt;the end user doesn’t need to think about copyright&lt;/em&gt;. All they need to is follow the human-readable licence terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using CC licences can reduce the amount of time teachers (and others) spend thinking about copyright, and also reduce any legal risks, by ensuring that the people using your resources know exactly what they can (and cannot) do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously a challenge. While large sharing portals are making it easier than ever to add a licence, it can seem like One More Thing. But remember: by adding a licence, you’re ensuring that others, further down the line, can spend less time thinking about copyright. And that, I think, is something we (and maybe even lawyers) can all get behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt McGregor is the Public Lead of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Education</category><category>Matt McGregor</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/do-i-really-have-to-think-about-copyright.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2015 12:52:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>OER in Australia: Its Time Has Come</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/oer-in-australia-its-time-has-come.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL COPYRIGHT UNIT
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Open Educational Resources (OER) was coined at UNESCO’s 2002 Forum on Open Courseware. It means “teaching, learning and research materials in any medium, digital or otherwise, that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open licence that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OER initiatives are emerging at an increasing rate throughout Australia, both at the government and institutional levels. Unlike NZ, where OER is being implemented organically at a school level with the assistance of Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ), OER in Australia is being implemented by governments and educational bodies as part of the Australian Government Open Licensing Programme, AusGOAL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Copyright Unit (NCU) is the new Education Lead of Creative Commons Australia, and for many years has been an active advocate of Creative Commons and the OER movement. NCU negotiates and manages the compulsory and voluntary copyright licences on behalf of the Australian School and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) sectors, and advocates for copyright law reform on behalf of the School and TAFE sectors. NCU also &lt;a title="Smartcopying" href="http://www.smartcopying.edu.au/" target="_blank"&gt;provides copyright advice&lt;/a&gt; and education to the School and TAFE sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its role as Creative Commons Education Lead, NCU also runs an education programme on &lt;a title="CC licences" href="http://www.smartcopying.edu.au/open-education/creative-commons" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons licences&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a title="OERs" href="http://www.smartcopying.edu.au/open-education/open-education-resources" target="_blank"&gt; use and adoption of OERs&lt;/a&gt; for the School and TAFE sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increasing recognition of value and benefits of OER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Government and education administering bodies now recognise that OER policies can impact and assist on a range of copyright compliance and education policy issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OER will assist in managing costs, both copyright licensing costs and traditional learning material costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;OER can make an important contribution to the most pressing problem facing education systems around the world: delivering better results with fewer resources.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Free or inexpensive resources licensed under an open licence should be an option considered by teaching organisations.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Using OER will also reduce copyright licensing costs. Despite best efforts by the Copyright Advisory Group (CAG) and NCU, copying volumes continue to go up and exclusions are varying from year to year.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OER will deliver greater learning efficiency, especially in regards to digital ICT policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Educators are able to easily use the work of others and build upon those as needed, as opposed to starting from scratch;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;When educators leave a role, both the school and the educator are still entitled to use the resources the educator created;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;OER allows greater collaboration between education department and authorities, domestically and internationally;&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;OER encourages the use of new digital technologies and allows collaboration between students, parents, teachers and schools; thus allowing schools to reach their State/Territory’s digital ICT policy goals.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OER helps manage copyright compliance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;OER removes many of the roadblocks associated with traditional copyright and reduces copyright compliance issues and costs.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;It promotes continuous improvement of instruction and personalised learning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently all the Australian Departments of Education agreed to license their websites and publications under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY 4.0) where possible. &lt;a title="Tasmania" href="https://www.education.tas.gov.au/About_us/Pages/Copyright-and-Disclaimer.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Tasmania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="South Australia" href="http://www.sa.gov.au/copyright" target="_blank"&gt;South Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Queensland" href="http://education.qld.gov.au/home/copyr.html" target="_blank"&gt;Queensland&lt;/a&gt; Departments of Education have done so and the other states/territories are in the process of implementation. The non-government school sectors are beginning to license their learning resources under Creative Commons licences as well, to ensure wider sharing and building of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other OER initiatives in Australia include &lt;a title="Education Services Australia" href="http://www.esa.edu.au/" target="_blank"&gt;Education Services Australia&lt;/a&gt; licensing more than 1,600 digital learning resources from the national digital resources collection under Creative Commons licences (with hopefully many more to come). These CC-licensed resources are available from &lt;a title="Scootle" href="http://www.scootle.edu.au/ec/lobjects.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Scootle&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a title="Australian Curriculum" href="http://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au" target="_blank"&gt;Australian Curriculum&lt;/a&gt; is also licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence in order to ensure that the curriculum is widely accessible to teachers and schools, and to facilitate the development of teaching and learning resources. NCU expects to see more and more publicly funded educational resources licensed under Creative Commons licences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OER Toolkit for Schools Curriculum Developers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCU is developing an OER toolkit for School-sector E-learning and Curriculum Developers. The toolkit is a practical guide designed to support curriculum creators in understanding and making use of open educational materials, and ensuring future materials are able to be openly licensed. It provides detailed information on Creative Commons licences and how to use them. Importantly, we have developed a ‘best of’ OER list to assist people in finding high-quality OERs quickly. And, in the true spirit of the OER movement, NCU’s toolkit is built on the fantastic CC-licensed works of CCANZ’s publication “Free to Mix” , the Leiscester City Council “OER Guidance for Schools”, and the ‘&lt;a title="OER copyright licensing toolkit" href="http://www.oerafrica.org/resource/oer-copyright-and-licensing-toolkit" target="_blank"&gt;OER Copyright and Licensing Toolkit’&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a title="SAIDE" href="http://www.saide.org.za/" target="_blank"&gt;South African Institute for Distance Education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright 4 Educators on Peer 2 Peer University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCU is one of the foundational courses of P2PU School Open, and has run the &lt;a title="Copyright 4 Educators" href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/3040/copyright-4-educators-aus/" target="_blank"&gt;Copyright 4 Educators&lt;/a&gt; course through &lt;a title="P2PU" href="https://p2pu.org/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Peer 2 Peer University&lt;/a&gt; (P2PU) since 2009. P2PU is a grassroots open education project that organises learning outside of institutional walls and gives learners recognition for their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright 4 Educators has &lt;a title="OER week" href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/3040/content/6756/" target="_blank"&gt;one week dedicated to OER&lt;/a&gt; and Creative Commons licences. This course is run online, twice a year with an intake of approximately 60 learners. The course is unbelievably popular. Enrolments for the course usually fills within 48 hours and has, on average, a wait list of 70 people! The average retention rate for the seven-week course is 87% over the past two years. The NCU is looking to run an entire course dedicated to OER in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why Open Education Resources are good for Australian schools, teachers and students&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Australia, the current collective copyright licence schemes and free-use exceptions for educational uses by teachers and schools are expensive, restrictive and complicated.  Educators’ valuable time is spent trying to understand complex copyright rules and seeking permission to use educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian schools pay over $665 million to purchase educational resources each year. These resources cannot be modified, shared or remixed by teachers and students except in very limited circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big problem is that many teachers believe that they are allowed to use material from the internet for free in their classes and at their school. This is not the case. Teachers downloading, saving, printing or emailing pages from the internet will attract fees payable under the education statutory licence for schools. Generally the only material that is free for teachers and schools to use from the internet is online material that is licensed under Creative Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Australian schools pay approximately $90 million a year to copyright collecting societies. On the other hand, OER can provide the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safer&lt;/b&gt;: It is much safer for teachers to use OERs, as they are free to reuse, remix, redistribute and adapt without running the risk of breaching the complex copyright exceptions and copyright licence rules.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Internet compatible&lt;/b&gt;: It is better adapted to the internet and the freedom that provides to copy, distribute, adapt and remix resources.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enabler&lt;/b&gt;: Resources that are free to access are not necessarily free to reuse, remix or adapt. There are many online sources of information that can be freely accessed but often the right to adapt or remix is reserved to the copyright owner. Embedding third-party content in educational resources also prevents that content from being shared and copied without permission of the copyright owner. OER enables educators to reuse, remix and adapt resources, since the copyright owner has already given permission to everyone.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessible&lt;/b&gt;: It is easy to access openly licensed materials, with over 800 million CC-licensed works and many searchable online databases of CC-licensed work available.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collaborative&lt;/b&gt;: It encourages collaboration between educators and creates communities based on the sharing of educational resources, which can increase the quality of materials and the development of ideas.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cheaper&lt;/b&gt;: It helps to save money on national copyright fees and the administrative costs of seeking permission, and allows educational resources to be shared freely online with very low transaction costs.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equitable&lt;/b&gt;: It offers equal access to knowledge for everyone and allows for educational resources to be adapted for minorities and those with disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schools using Creative Commons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OER is also being adopted at the local, school level. Teachers and students are increasingly using OER to eliminate copyright concerns and bypass the complex copyright rules. OER allows for significantly more engagement with materials than the Australian educational copyright licences and exceptions allow, and enables educators to fully use, adapt and share resources with their school community and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the above reasons, OER is best suited for the modern-day classroom. And, due to this, it is being picked up daily by different schools, teachers and students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such school, &lt;a title="Carina State School" href="https://carinass.eq.edu.au/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Carina State School&lt;/a&gt;, a primary school in Brisbane, Queensland, recently held its first carnival in 16 years, and it also set a new standard for Australian schools by &lt;a title="Carina school CC" href="http://www.smartcopying.edu.au/open-education/creative-commons/carina-state-school-a-creative-commons-community" target="_blank"&gt;being an exemplar&lt;/a&gt; Creative Commons Community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school held an amazing School Carnival Art Gallery in which Creative Commons licences were applied to all of the student works. Creative Commons music was played in the gallery, which avoided any additional costs or copyright concerns, and the school has plans to use Creative Commons licences in future activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The school has taken a proactive approach to copyright by using the Creative Commons licences, and has introduced them to their students in a fun, creative and practical way, in the first event of its kind in Australia!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take-home message for the school, students, parents and all that attended the Carnival was that Creative Commons licences work! They’re a simple way to overcome copyright concerns and allow for greater dissemination and sharing of artwork, culture and information generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The National Copyright Unit of the Australian Government's Education Council advises and represents Australian schools and TAFEs on copyright issues, negotiates copyright licences for the sector and liaises with education, industry and government on copyright policy issues. The NCU is the Education lead of &lt;a title="CC Australia" href="http://creativecommons.org.au/" target="_blank"&gt;CC Australia&lt;/a&gt; and manages the ‘Smartcopying’ website -- &lt;a title="SmartCopying" href="http://www.smartcopying.edu.au/" target="_blank"&gt;smartcopying.edu.au&lt;/a&gt; -- a practical resource on copyright for Australian educators.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Australian National Copyright Unit</category><category>Education</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/oer-in-australia-its-time-has-come.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2015 11:25:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>More Collaboration in Tertiary Education</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/more-collaboration-in-tertiary-ed.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;BY HUNTER WILSON-BURKE&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand we have 33 public tertiary educational institutions, comprising eight universities, 20 institutes of technology, and three wānanga (Māori centres of tertiary learning). Under the Education Act 1989, all of these institutions have the authority to award degrees recognised by the New Zealand National Qualifications Authority. While the breadth of tertiary provision is generally positive, the current system also causes some problems -- problems that open licensing may be able to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diverse tertiary sector combined with New Zealand's widely distributed population has meant there is an extensive national network of institutions offering a core set of qualifications throughout the country. However, the historical funding model employed by the New Zealand government has encouraged competition between tertiary institutions. While this can be an incentive for providing high-quality educational services, it can also lead to unnecessary inefficiencies. Competition between institutions often means that teachers and researchers are forced to spend much of their time creating resources that already exist elsewhere in the educational system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current intellectual property models used by most New Zealand tertiary institutions further exacerbate inefficiencies, causing the production of unnecessary duplications of qualifications and materials. For instance, in 2012 there were 62 registered qualifications available in New Zealand intended for the education and training of tertiary teachers. It seems counterintuitive for so many variants of the same qualification to produce, from scratch, their own course materials, especially when teachers and researchers could be working in collaboration to create comprehensive and adaptable Open Educational Resources (OERs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OERs in New Zealand's tertiary sector could provide an alternative to the duplication of course materials by competing qualifications. Generic and widespread resources created under an open licence would allow New Zealand institutions to collaborate together. Reusing and remixing resources across institutions can mean that high-quality learning materials are widely dispersed and accessible to the general population. The adoption of OER courses, or at least course materials for less specialised qualifications, would provide an excellent testing ground. This would allow for New Zealand's tertiary education systems to explore the potential of open education as a mechanism for reducing internal costs and production inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student at Victoria University, my main expense -- barring course costs -- is textbooks. Often these are simply a collection of photocopied excerpts from various books and journal articles. While textbook costs vary, it is not unusual to spend thousands of dollars over the course of a degree for books that are often used for little over three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began &lt;a title="MIT OpenCourseWare" href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;OpenCourseWare&lt;/a&gt;, a project in which they began publishing their course materials under Creative Commons licences, making them freely available to the public for reuse and repurposing. Since then several universities have followed suit, openly publishing course materials and making them available to the commons. In New Zealand a number of tertiary institutions are already part of the &lt;a title="OERu" href="http://oeru.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Resources Universitas&lt;/a&gt; (OERu), an independent network that offers free online courses for students worldwide. Despite the benefits of Open Educational Resources (OERs) and their increasing popularity among tertiary institutions, the movement has not garnered widespread publicity or institutionalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my time at Victoria University I have noticed small changes taking place. It is becoming increasingly common for courses to be based on a series of online journal articles instead of a textbook. However, these journal articles are usually not openly licensed, and are instead made available to students and staff members of Victoria University through agreements the university has with other institutions. This means they cannot legally be shared outside of the university domain and are vulnerable to changes in intellectual property law. For example, current negotiations regarding the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement could jeopardise the use of several online journal articles at university. Thus, while these changes indicate an awareness and interest in moving forwards from expensive textbooks, they do not address the wider issue of open education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with several professors at Victoria University to hear their perspectives on the matter. Ideologically, staff members were very supportive of open education policies being adopted in universities, speaking positively about the benefits of OERs. These include expanding the scope of education, especially to those in financially restrictive situations; enabling them to enrich their students’ learning experience with increased resources; and allowing students to easily teach others what they have learned. Staff were also very enthusiastic about publishing their works openly, allowing them to easily share and distribute their work without worrying about restrictive copyright laws. Despite the ideological alignment and positivity shown by staff, many were at a loss concerning the logistical implementation of OERs and how it would affect the university financially and commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conversations demonstrated the necessity of increased visibility of the open education movement and its proposed solutions to current problems. There are a number of economic benefits for educational institutions using OERs: for example, the money saved through using existing OERs from reliable institutions; and efficiencies created from the collective action of several institutions creating a large depository of academically sound OERs across a wide range of disciplines and through institutional backing and grassroots community support. The formulation of alternative business models allowing for the sustained production of OERs and an increased awareness of the alternative forms of copyright available is an integral aspect of furthering the use of OERs in tertiary institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robin Bond, a semi-retired Classics lecturer from Canterbury, has spent his life translating and directing ancient Greek theatre. Over the years he has amassed a series of his own translations of all the Greek plays we know of, in verse, created specifically to be staged, as well as studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He could have published these as a volume, a small run from an academic press that would have been the culmination of a career (not that his career is over by a long stretch, you’d have to physically restrain him from teaching, directing and studying). This could have sat in academic libraries, and influenced classics students for years to come, if they bought it. Libraries already have copies of all of these already -- different translations, translated for different purposes, and even editions in the original Greek. In these lean times for library acquisitions sales might have been pretty sparse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, over lunch, I convinced Robin to send me the manuscripts, I had a book designer look over them and make them beautiful, and we have started to pop them up on our Institutional Repository. The first play we have put up is &lt;a title="Antigone" href="http://hdl.handle.net/10092/9681" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antigone&lt;/em&gt;, by Sophocles&lt;/a&gt;. We will have them all up by &lt;a title="OA Week" href="http://www.openaccessweek.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Access Week&lt;/a&gt; (October) this year. They are all published with a &lt;a title="CC BY" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Commons Attribution licence&lt;/a&gt; (CC BY).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that something will happen. Sitting on the repository is useful, but they are just raw material. Content. I’m hoping that someone will make a lovely web page for them, or include them in a course, realising that they are free for anyone to use. I really hope that someone will stage one of these, using these as the text to work from, because that’s what they were originally for. What I most want though, is someone uses them for something that we haven’t even thought of. That a school picks one up, and turns it into a musical. Or animates one. Or projects it into space on a laser beam for aliens. Actually, I might do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Arduino Morse" href="https://github.com/markfickett/arduinomorse" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s an arduino library&lt;/a&gt; to create the Morse code -- so now all I need is the laser...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine as a high school teacher needing to teach a subject that you have barely heard of, has never been taught before in schools, and it counts towards a student’s graduating assessment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened to many teachers in 2011, when New Zealand became one of the first countries in the English-speaking world to offer Computer Science as a formal topic in high school. As in many other countries, prior to this, computing had been taught in a way that viewed students as &lt;i&gt;users&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;developers&lt;/i&gt;. However, due to New Zealand being an early adopter, there were very few resources available for teachers, and those that were available were disparate, generally being pitched at a level that was too high (e.g. university courses) or too low (e.g. the CS Unplugged activities for primary school children).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this, the &lt;a title="Computer Science Research Group at Canterbury University" href="http://cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/research/RG/CSE/" target="_blank"&gt;Computer Science Education Research Group&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Canterbury (also known as the "Department of Fun Stuff") started work on the &lt;a title="Computer Science Field Guide" href="http://csfieldguide.org.nz" target="_blank"&gt;Computer Science Field Guide&lt;/a&gt;, an online "textbook" to serve as a resource for high school students and a guide for teachers. The demand for the resource was so high that it was already getting heavy use while it was still being developed, to the point that we now just call it a "beta" release, and are constantly working to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online book has been designed to be engaging and give a quirky approach to the topics, making good use of genuinely interactive activities to enable students to experience the concepts first-hand. It generally uses a constructivist approach, where we aim to lead students through experiences that enable them to construct concepts in their own minds, rather than us simply giving them information. We have developed short videos for the start of each chapter to raise some of the questions that the topic addresses, usually in a humorous way, and presented by a Computer Science student so that the material is authentic and approachable -- for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hwqmu6pvr6g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following in the footsteps of its sister site &lt;a title="Computer Science Unplugged" href="http://csunplugged.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Computer Science Unplugged&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended for primary-aged students, the CS Field Guide does not require &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; programming of the students. This is to prevent learning programming being a barrier for students to engage with the exciting and surprising ideas in Computer Science; in fact, for some students, finding out what Computer Science is will be a motivator to learn to program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike licence, so users are welcome to take copies and modify them. The material is produced using the open-source &lt;a title="Sphinx" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; system, which was originally designed for writing Python documentation, and works from plain-text source files using the reStructuredText format (although we are in the process of changing to a more manageable format). The interactives are written using JavaScript and HTML5, and the videos are released on vimeo.com so that teachers can download them. All of these components are released with the Creative Commons licence so that the entire book can be reconstructed independently. Many people have contributed to different parts of the guide with videos, interactive activities, images and ideas, although most of the writing has been done by just a few people, which has kept it more consistent and coherent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guide is currently presented as a website, and the various components are carefully configured to work on as many systems as possible, especially bearing in mind that some schools operate using very old computer labs or old versions of software, while others may primarily use tablets, which places a lot of restrictions on the technologies that can be used effectively. Often if a teacher encounters something that won't work, they need to apply for new software to be installed, and even if it's approved it may take some time, so our goal is to put in as few barriers as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system we're using can also generate pdf and ebook (epub and mobi) versions of the text. Teachers appreciate being able to print a copy (although this obviously loses the video and interactive components). The ebook versions are still under development as our priority has been to fill out the online web version first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/imagebitcomparer.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-526" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/imagebitcomparer-300x172.png" alt="Computer Science Field Guide, licensed CC BY-NC-SA" width="300" height="172"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Computer Science Field Guide, licensed CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why have the resource open?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several reasons for choosing to keep the resource as open as possible:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Open Source is natural for the Computer Science community. Programming languages tend to be open source, or at least available at no cost. From a teaching point of view, this means that students can use the resources on any computer and at home without restriction. Teachers and students come to expect Computer Science resources to be free, and any that aren't may be overlooked. The approach we're taking is modeled after (and in cooperation with) the &lt;a title="Runestone Interactive" href="http://runestoneinteractive.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Runestone Interactive&lt;/a&gt; project, which offers several interactive open-source Computer Science books.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We have limited resources (both time and money), and don't want the book to be limited by our capacity, yet we needed to get something out quickly.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;It's important for the resource to be adaptable. NZ has been leading the world in Computer Science in high schools, and there is strong interest in our resources, so by making it open it can be readily adapted for overseas contexts where the curriculum may be similar but not exactly the same. This also makes translation simple -- no special permission is required.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;We can use other open resources as part of the guide; for example, some xkcd comics relate well to the topic, and can be used in this context.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Being open gives teachers security that the resource won't go away or date, since someone else can pick it up if we are unable to continue with it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers have reported copying sections of the guide to their own local school pages, and making selected parts available to students to help them focus; being open gives the flexibility for them to customise it for their students, or simply use it as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/computersciencefieldguide.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-527" src="http://nzcommons.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/computersciencefieldguide-300x153.png" alt="Computer Science Field Guide, licensed CC BY-NC-SA" width="300" height="153"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Computer Science Field Guide, licensed CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing a school "textbook" with shared authorship and open content creates a number of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these is how to deal with "secret" parts of the book. Many textbooks have a teachers' version that includes answers to questions. Teachers appreciate having these answers available so they can be sure they've got things right and then help stimulate discussion about the question. Openness brings the concern that a student might download the teacher version and subvert their own learning by simply reading off answers instead of thinking though the questions. Our approach has been that the teacher version contains a lot of material that teachers value but students would find uninteresting, and the hope is that students won't be interested in delving in to it for the wrong reasons. In end, students need to realise that the goal is for them to learn, rather than to look smart in class or annoy their teacher!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teacher version is generated from the same source file as the student version, which makes editing and consistency a lot easier than having two versions. The Sphinx system has commands for the conditional use of sections of text; this can be expanded in the future to accommodate other versions, perhaps for slightly different curricula or year levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is keeping the resource consistent. Authors have a remarkably wide variety of styles, and we have gone for a slightly quirky and constructivist style. Another author might see the constructivism as not giving all the information, and in an open source environment that could come in and "fill in the gaps", inadvertently undermining the pedagogy. Everyone has opinions on how education should be done, and if the material ends up being done "by committee", then it's hard for it to be vibrant and have character. Also, the author needs to understand the audience (in this case, NZ teenagers and their teachers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, diverse authorship hasn't been a major problem, because all the writing has been done within a small close-knit group, but it's possible that other versions may fork from ours. Our hope is that if a new version is better it will flourish, and if not, it will have been a useful experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation of open books is also a challenge that we have yet to tackle properly. An open-source textbook can be copied by others who want to add a fork in the content. If the original guide is changed, the copy becomes out of date. The same applies to translations of the guide, since each translation is also a new version, and later updates may need to be re-translated. This is a wide challenge in open publishing -- for example, until recently, Wikipedia simply allowed different translations of articles to appear independently, so inevitably they would get out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is that the software behind a site needs to be open to make the content truly open. In our case, the main text processing is all done by open-source software, but there are elements (such as the video production) that use proprietary software. The sister site, CS Unplugged, has a similar issue, where currently the source of the main book is available in MS Word. The content is open, but users are forced to use proprietary software to edit the document. They could use OpenOffice, but the formatting gets badly messed up. Of course, the document is available as pdf as well, but that can't be edited easily. Ultimately we may revert to a similar system to the field guide, a plain-text markup language as the source, and then many different formats generated from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing an open source "textbook" has many challenges, but the benefits of getting it to schools quickly and giving teachers confidence that they can have some control over the content (in principle at least) has been worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we went on the road with Billy Meinke, now with the University of Hawaii and formerly of Creative Commons International. Billy was in the country for the Open Source // Open Society conference (which you can read more about &lt;a title="Education: a commons-based future" href="http://nzcommons.org.nz/project/education-a-commons-based-future/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). We used Billy's arrival as an excuse to organise events promoting open textbooks in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, beginning in Auckland on 13 April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each event took a similar structure. First, Fabiana Kubke or I introduced Creative Commons, and outlined what Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand wanted to see in the sector. Next, Billy talked about some of the open education projects he's been involved in, including the $2billion TAACCCT project to develop open workplace training resources. Finally, Erika Pearson, Simon Hart and Richard White from the University of Otago talked about the Media Text Hack, a successful project to develop an open educational resource -- in a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an edited excerpt of a transcript from the talk Billy Meinke gave at the Open Source Open Society conference in Wellington in April 2015. Meinke is an educational technologist with College of Education at the University of Hawaii, and was formerly on the education team at Creative Commons international HQ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital content is non-rivalrous, meaning that I can take something I have and give it to you, without losing anything myself. You see it all over the place on the internet, memes being shared and remixed and shared again. It’s collective creativity on a massive scale, but the law hasn’t adapted to suit the affordances of the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever-increasingly restrictive copyright laws have been introduced over the last few decades, extending the default length of time it takes for works to enter the public domain automatically. When you create a work in the United States, we’ll be waiting 70 years or more after your death until we can freely reuse your work. [50 years in NZ.] Does that sound reasonable in a digital age? In an age where the marginal cost of copying and transmitting digital artifacts is mere fractions of a penny? I think not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright (and patents) were originally designed to last a period of time long enough to incentivise the creation of new works. But several times during the 20th century, the default copyright term was exended after big media firms won cases to further lock away the likes of Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and the Happy Birthday song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You made it; now you should be able to exploit it. What if we wanted to share it out? What if we wanted to build things with people who have shared interests, but live across the globe? What if we wanted to set our works free, or contribute to something larger than ourselves? Open licenses for content and code are at the ready and have allowed us to put our collective creativity into the commons how and when we wish to. The Creative Commons, the GNU Public Licence, and others have been critical in allowing this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is, we are making headway together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are real threats to this (such as the Trans Pacific Partnership), we’re actually sitting on the most robust commons we’ve ever had. Countless free and open-source software projects provides technical infrastructure that we rely on every day. Content and code and data are being put into the commons at a rate that should make every single one of us smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a commons-based future, educational opportunity is ubiquitous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to learn can learn. The only barrier to education is the willingness to try. And when you try, you have a pool of shared knowledge at your fingertips that we could have only dreamt of in the past. You don’t think in terms of a textbook, because the web is your learning platform, and &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; own your educational future. And when you want to know more, you’re connected to other citizens who share your thirst for knowledge. You begin to string together digital artifacts along your journey, and you can see how others navigated the seas of open educational resources before you. You create your own pathways that others can follow after you move on. You participate in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arts and culture.&lt;/strong&gt; You have the world’s cultural heritage available to you. You search the archives of thousands of museums in hundreds of countries, and help curate collections of millions of images and sounds and videos that tell the story of &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; world before now. You can see streams of artifacts flowing into the commons as new discoveries are unearthed. You can walk the halls of the Louvre or the Smithsonian or any number of places anywhere on earth that you’ve always wished to see. When you find something truly compelling, you take a 3D scan of it and print it at the local library. You place your hands on history, work with it, play with it, understand it. You make new things from the things of ages past. You breathe life into history. You participate in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research and science.&lt;/strong&gt; You stand on the shoulders of giants and tap into a distributed body of research that spans all domains of science. You have access to the latest studies and reports, and to the underlying data and code that produced them. You can ask questions of the data that no one thought to do, or was able to before it was free. You make visualisations from it that help others find meaning in it. You thumb through sciencific studies being done all over the world in real-time. You can be a part of a community of enthusiasts who push the limits of what it means to be a citizen scientist. Science, for you, is a living breathing thing, and you’re participating in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government&lt;/strong&gt; operates openly, bringing a heightened level of transparency and efficiency. Civic data is a few keystrokes away, and the government invites you to make the data more useful and consumable. Legislation is codified and publicly versioned, and you’re notified when a change is proposed or made to the laws you care the most about. Citizens are more informed and involved in the ways their tax dollars are spent, and they support government leaders who work to ensure this transparency continues in perpetuity. You have knowledge about your community and your world in the palm of your hand. You’re participating in the commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commons-based future isn’t a fantasy, as you may have begun to think. Every one of the advantages and capabilities and freedoms I have mentioned are based on technology we have today. And each of them is happening somewhere in the world, but none of them are happening everywhere in the world. By participating in the commons, we can work towards a future where more people have a life that involves the commons. The commons can grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Billy Meinke</category><category>Education</category><guid>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/education-a-commons-based-future.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:58:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>NZ's OER Foundation</title><link>http://nzcommons.org.nz/posts/nzs-open-education-resource-foundation.html</link><dc:creator>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne Mackintosh is the Director of the &lt;a title="OERF" href="http://wikieducator.org/OERF:Home" target="_blank"&gt;Open Education Resource Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (OERF), an international non-profit organisation based in Dunedin. The OERF aims to promote the development and use of Open Educational Resources (OER) as a sustainable and renewable resource. Wayne also holds the UNESCO/COL/ICDE Chair in OER based at Otago Polytechnic and the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Wayne and began by asking about how he entered the world of Open Educational Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spent the majority of my academic career working in open distance learning, including the University of South Africa, the biggest provider of distance learning in Africa. In 2002, I moved to New Zealand to help set up a distance and flexible learning centre at the University of Auckland. The idea behind the centre was to promote collaboration in elearning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What was the state of open education in 2001?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that ‘open education’ is an umbrella term. When we talk about open education, we’re talking about not only open educational resources, but also open source software, open governance, open policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But in 2001, open education was virtually unheard of, and there was very little happening in terms of OER development. The concept itself wasn’t coined until a conference hosted by UNESCO in 2002. This is ironic, of course, as teaching is all about sharing knowledge freely -- it’s fundamental to what teachers do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In those days, we focused on the development and adoption of open source software, as this was considered the best way to introduce the concept of open education to the tertiary sector in New Zealand. Thanks to significant investment in that area from the government of the day, we were able to assist with the development of the open source learning management system Moodle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Partly as a result of that work, New Zealand has the highest rates of adoption of Moodle in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did OER develop over the decade?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the first decade, the focus of the movement  was on advocacy -- just getting the message out and educating folks about open education. As the advocacy efforts developed, the donor community began to fund OER development. The William and Flora Hewitt Foundation in particular has funded a number of the OER projects, including projects like the open courseware initiative from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing the fruits of some of that early development now, with the adoption of open policy for major projects like the $2billion TAACCCT fund for educational resources for community colleges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happened after leaving the University of Auckland? How did you get from there to the OERF?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After the University of Auckland, I moved to represent New Zealand at the &lt;a title="Commonwealth of Learning" href="http://www.col.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Commonwealth of Learning&lt;/a&gt;, based in Vancouver, where my work focused on the adoption of open educational practices and open source software in education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After leaving the COL, I moved to set up the Open Education Resource Foundation. After looking around the world, I saw that the only higher education institution with an open policy for educational resources was &lt;a title="Otago Polytech IP policy" href="http://wikieducator.org/Otago_Polytechnic:_An_IP_policy_for_the_times" target="_blank"&gt;Otago Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt; -- which is how the OERF came to be based in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Happily, the Council of Otago Polytechnic were brave and forward-thinking enough to take us on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does the OERF do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The OERF has two flagship initiatives. The first is &lt;a title="Wikieducator" href="http://wikieducator.org/Main_Page" target="_blank"&gt;Wikieducator&lt;/a&gt;, which is a platform for the global education community to share and edit educational resources with 58,000 registered account holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The second is the OERu, which is a consortium of higher education institutions committed to providing truly free and open education, including open courses using only open educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The mission of the OERu is to develop a sustainable ecosystem of open educational resources. All partner institutions commit to produce two free courses based entirely on OER, providing free access to all learners. Assessment services are then provided on a cost-recovery model. This model enables us to reduce the costs of tuition to the learner to as little as 20% of current costs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s next? What does the future of OER look like?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There’s still a long way to go. From my perspective, OER is inevitable -- no model of knowledge production can match the efficiency of OER. The real challenge, though, is how long it takes for institutions to develop a culture of sharing. Working for cultural change within traditional and conservative institutions -- as higher education institutions tend to be -- takes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It’s important that we keep working to develop skills within the tertiary sector. This is still relatively little knowledge or expertise in OER, and this will need to change in order to make OER development and use mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From a policy level, we need a stronger commitment from central government and tertiary education institutions to ensure that all educational resources produced by publicly funded institutions are made openly available. People often ask about the ‘sustainability’ of OER. It’s not rocket science: we already fund the production of open educational resources. We just need to make sure the resources that are already produced within universities are made available as OER using Creative Commons licences."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should New Zealand tertiary education institutions do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It’s essential that institutions pass policies to support the development and use of OER. This is going to take some time. One of the difficulties in working the tertiary sector is that institutions are competitive with each other. We say that if institutions are worried about competition, they should join the OERu. As I said earlier, our open model enables us to reduce the costs of tuition to the learner to 20% of costs at existing mainstream institutions. The OERu is the new competition."&lt;/p&gt;
